This Eclipse Foundation Project adheres to the [Eclipse Foundation Vulnerability Reporting Policy](https://www.eclipse.org/security/policy/).

## How To Report a Vulnerability

If you think you have found a vulnerability in this repository, please report it to us through coordinated disclosure.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Instead, report it using one of the following ways:

* Contact the [Eclipse Foundation Security Team](mailto:security@eclipse-foundation.org) via email
* Create a [confidential issue](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/security/vulnerability-reports/-/issues/new?issuable_template=new_vulnerability) in the Eclipse Foundation Vulnerability Reporting Tracker

You can find more information about reporting and disclosure at the [Eclipse Foundation Security page](https://www.eclipse.org/security/).

Please include as much of the information listed below as you can to help us better understand and resolve the issue:

* The type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting)
* Affected version(s)
* Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue
* Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
* The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
* Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
* Configuration required to reproduce the issue
* Log files that are related to this issue (if possible)

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.
