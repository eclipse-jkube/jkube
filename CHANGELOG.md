# Changes

This document main purpose is to list changes which might affect backwards compatibility. It will not list all releases as Eclipse JKube is build in a continous delivery fashion.

We use semantic versioning in some slight variation until our feature set has stabilized and the missing pieces has been filled in:

* The `MAJOR_VERSION` is kept to `0`
* The `MINOR_VERSION` changes when there is an API or configuration change which is not fully backward compatible.
* The `PATCH_LEVEL` is used for regular CD releases which add new features and bug fixes.

After this we will switch probably to real [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org/)

## Extracting changelog portions
We provide a script to extract changelog portions and automatic link building to send notifications
(i.e. e-mail) about new releases
([scripts/extract-changelog-for-version.sh](https://github.com/eclipse/jkube/blob/master/scripts/extract-changelog-for-version.sh))

Usage:
```
# ./scripts/changelog.sh semanticVersionNumber [linkLabelStartNumber]
./scripts/extract-changelog-for-version.sh 1.3.37 5
```
