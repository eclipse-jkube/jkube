# Changes

This document main purpose is to list changes which might affect backwards compatibility. It will not list all releases as Eclipse Jkube is build in a continous delivery fashion.

We use semantic versioning in some slight variation until our feature set has stabilized and the missing pieces has been filled in:

* The `MAJOR_VERSION` is kept to `0`
* The `MINOR_VERSION` changes when there is an API or configuration change which is not fully backward compatible.
* The `PATCH_LEVEL` is used for regular CD releases which add new features and bug fixes.

After this we will switch probably to real [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org/)

### 0.1.1-SNAPSHOT

* Refactor #29: Add Maven Enforcer Plugin

### 0.1.0 (19-12-2019)
