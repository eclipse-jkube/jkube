[[vertx-scenario]]
== Vert.x

You can easily get started with using {plugin} on an https://start.vertx.io/[Eclipse Vert.x] without providing any explicit configuration. {plugin} would generate an opinionated container image and manifests by inspecting your project configuration.

=== How to set Service Port?

By default, in Vert.x applications, application port value is 8888. {plugin} opinionated defaults use port 8080. If you want to change this, you'll need to configure {plugin} to generate image with desired port:

{pluginExtension} {
  generator {
      config {
          'vertx' {
              webPort = '8888'
          }
      }
  }
}

Once configured, you can go ahead and deploy application to Kubernetes:
