== Zero Configuration

It's very common, especially when dealing with the inner development loop, that you
don't need to provide any configuration for your Gradle project.
You can get started simply by adding the plugin to your build.gradle file:

.Example for setting up the {plugin} in build.gradle
[source,groovy,subs="attributes+"]
----
plugins {
  id 'org.eclipse.jkube.{pluginExtension}' version '{version}'
}
----

In this case, {plugin} analyzes your project and configures the container image and the
cluster configuration manifests using a set of opinionated defaults.
