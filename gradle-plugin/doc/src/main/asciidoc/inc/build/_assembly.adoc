The `assembly` element within `build` element defines how build artifacts and other files
can be added to the Docker image.

[[config-image-build-assembly]]
.Assembly Configuration (<<config-image, image >> : <<config-image-build, build >>)
[cols="1,5"]
|===
| Element | Description

| *name*
| Assembly name, which is `maven` by default. This name is used for the archives and directories created during the build.
  This directory holds the files specified by the assembly. If an <<external-dockerfile,external Dockerfile>> is used then
  this name is also the relative directory which contains the assembly files.

| *targetDir*
| Directory under which the files and artifacts contained in the assembly will be copied within the container.
  The default value for this is `${assembly.name}`, so `/maven` if *name* is not set to a different value.

| <<build-assembly-layer, *inline*>>
| _Deprecated: Use layers instead_
  Inlined assembly descriptor as described in <<build-assembly-layer,Assembly - Inline>> below.

| <<build-assembly-layer, *layers*>>
| Each of the layers that the assembly will contain as described in
  <<build-assembly-layer, Assembly - Layer>> below.

| *exportTargetDir*
| Specification whether the `targetDir` should be exported as a volume. This value is `true` by default except in the
  case the `targetDir` is set to the container root (`/`). It is also `false` by default when a base image is used with
  `from` since exporting makes no sense in this case and will waste disk space unnecessarily.

| *excludeFinalOutputArtifact*
| By default, the project's final artifact will be included in the assembly, set this flag to true in case the
  artifact should be excluded from the assembly.

| *mode*
a| Mode how the how the assembled files should be collected:

* `dir` : Files are simply copied (default),
* `tar` : Transfer via tar archive
* `tgz` : Transfer via compressed tar archive
* `zip` : Transfer via ZIP archive

The archive formats have the advantage that file permission can be preserved better (since the copying is independent
from the underlying files systems), but might triggers internal bugs from the Maven assembler (as it has been reported
in https://github.com/fabric8io/docker-maven-plugin/issues/171[#171])

| *permissions*
a| Permission of the files to add:

* `ignore` to use the permission as found on files regardless on any
assembly configuration
* `keep` to respect the assembly provided permissions
* `exec` for setting the executable bit on all files (required for Windows when using an assembly mode `dir`)
* `auto` to let the plugin select `exec` on Windows and `keep` on others.

`keep` is the default value.

| *tarLongFileMode*
| Sets the TarArchiver behaviour on file paths with more than 100 characters length. Valid values are: "warn"(default), "fail", "truncate", "gnu", "posix", "posix_warn" or "omit"

| *user*
a| User and/or group under which the files should be added. The user must already exist in the base image.

It has the general format `user[:group[:run-user]]`. The user and group can be given either as numeric user- and group-id or as names. The group id is optional.

If a third part is given, then the build changes to user `root` before changing the ownerships, changes the ownerships and then change to user `run-user` which is then used for the final command to execute. This feature might be needed, if the base image already changed the user (e.g. to 'jboss') so that a `chown` from root to this user would fail.

For example, the image `jboss/wildfly` use a "jboss" user under which all commands are executed. Adding files in Docker always happens under the UID root. These files can only be changed to "jboss" is the `chown` command is executed as root. For the following commands to be run again as "jboss" (like the final `standalone.sh`), the plugin switches back to user `jboss` (this is this "run-user") after changing the file ownership. For this example a specification of
`jboss:jboss:jboss` would be required.

In the event you do not need to include any artifacts with the image, you may safely omit this element from the configuration.

[[build-assembly-layer]]
=== Assembly - Inline/Layer

Inlined assembly description with a format very similar to
https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-assembly-plugin/assembly.html[Maven Assembly Plugin].

.Partial configuration example of an inline/layer element
[source,groovy,subs="attributes+"]
----
assembly {
    targetDir = "/deployments"
    layers = [{
        fileSets = [{
            directory = file("${project.rootDir}/build/dependencies")
            outputDirectory = "static"
       }]
    }]
}
----

The `layers` element within the `assembly` element can have one or more
`layer` elements with a Groovy DSL structure that supports the following configuration options:

.Assembly - Inline/Layer (<<config-image, image >> : <<config-image-build, build >> : <<config-image-build-assembly, assembly >>)
[cols="1,5"]
|===
| Element | Description

| *id*
| Unique ID for the layer.

| *files*
a| List of files for the layer.

Each file has the following fields:

* `source`: Absolute or relative path from the project's directory of the file to be included in the assembly.
* `outputDirectory`: Output directory relative to the root of the root directory of the assembly.
* `destName`: Destination filename in the outputDirectory.
* `fileMode`: Similar to a UNIX permission, sets the file mode of the file included.

| *fileSets*
a| List of filesets for the layer.

Each fileset has the following fields:

* `directory`: Absolute or relative location from the project's directory.
* `outputDirectory`: Output directory relative to the root of the root directory of the assembly fileSet.
* `includes`:  A set of files and directories to include.
**  If none is present, then everything is included.
** Files can be referenced by using their complete path name.
** Wildcards are also supported, patterns will be matched using
   https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/file/FileSystem.html#getPathMatcher(java.lang.String)[
   FileSystem#getPathMatcher] `glob` syntax.
* `excludes`: A set of files and directory to exclude.
** If none is present, then there are no exclusions.
** Wildcards are also supported, patterns will be matched using
https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/file/FileSystem.html#getPathMatcher(java.lang.String)[
FileSystem#getPathMatcher] `glob` syntax.
* `fileMode`: Similar to a UNIX permission, sets the file mode of the files included.
* `directoryMode`: Similar to a UNIX permission, sets the directory mode of the directories included.

| *baseDirectory*
| Base directory from which to resolve the Assembly's layer files and filesets.
