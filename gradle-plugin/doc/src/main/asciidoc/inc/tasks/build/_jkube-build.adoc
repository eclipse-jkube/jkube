=== *{task-prefix}Build*

This task is for building Docker images.

[[build-kubernetes]]
==== Kubernetes Build

A normal Docker build is performed by default. For Kubernetes builds the {plugin} uses the Docker remote API so the URL of your Docker Daemon must be specified. The URL can be specified by the dockerHost or machine configuration, or by the `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable.

The Docker remote API supports communication via SSL and authentication with certificates. The path to the certificates can be specified by the certPath or machine configuration, or by the `DOCKER_CERT_PATH` environment variable.

If you don't have access to docker daemon, you can change build strategy using `buildStrategy` option in groovy configuration like this:

.Example of overriding default build strategy
[source,groovy,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubernetes {
    buildStrategy = 'jib'
}
----

These are the different options supported by `buildStrategy`:

| *buildStrategy* | *Description*
| `docker`
| Docker build with a binary source

| `jib`
| Deamonless container image creation using https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib[JIB] build
|===

{plugin} by default tries to build up an opinionated <<config-image, Image Configuration>> by inspecting `build.gradle`. You can also provide your own <<dockerfile-scenario, Dockerfile>> or provide Custom ImageConfiguration via <<groovy-scenario-image, Groovy DSL configuration>>.
