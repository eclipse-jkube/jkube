[[jkubePush]]
=== *{task-prefix}Push*

This task uploads images to the registry which have a `build` configuration section.
The images to push can be restricted with the global option `filter` (see <<build-configuration,Build Goal Configuration>> for details).
The registry to push is by default `docker.io` but can be specified as part of the images's `name` the Docker way.
E.g. `docker.test.org:5000/data:1.5` will push the image `data` with tag `1.5` to the registry `docker.test.org` at port
`5000`.
Registry credentials (i.e. username and password) can be specified in multiple ways as described in section <<authentication,Authentication>>.
