[[jkubeHelm]]
=== *{task-prefix}Helm*

This task is for creating
https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts[Helm charts]
for your Gradle project so that you can install, update or delete your app in Kubernetes
using https://github.com/helm/helm[Helm].

For creating a Helm chart you simply call `{task-prefix}Helm` task on the command line:

[source, sh, subs="+attributes"]
----
gradle {task-prefix}Resource {task-prefix}Helm
----

The `{task-prefix}Resource` goal is required to create the resource descriptors which are included in the Helm chart.
If you have already built the resource then you can omit this task.

The configuration is defined in a `helm` section within the plugin's configuration:

.Example Helm configuration
[source,groovy,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
kubernetes {
  helm {
    chart = 'Jenkins'
    keywords = ['ci', 'cd', 'server']
    dependencies = [{
      name = 'ingress-nginx'
      version = '1.26.0'
      repository = 'https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx'
    }]
  }
}
----

This configuration section knows the following sub-elements in order to configure your Helm chart.

.Helm configuration

|===
| Element | Description | Property

| *chart*
| The Chart name.

Defaults to project name.
| `jkube.helm.chart`

| *version*
| The Chart SemVer version.

Defaults to project version
| `jkube.helm.version`

| *description*
| The Chart single-sentence description.

Defaults to project description.
| `jkube.helm.description`

| *home*
| The Chart URL for this project's home page.
| `jkube.helm.home`

| *sources*
| The Chart list of URLs to source code for this project.
|

| *<<helm-maintainers, maintainers>>*
| The Chart list of maintainers (name+email).
|

| *icon*
| The Chart URL to an SVG or PNG image to be used as an icon, default is extracted from the kubernetes manifest
  (`kubernetes.yml`) `jkube.io/iconUrl` annotation if not provided.
| `jkube.helm.icon`

| *keywords*
| Comma separated list of keywords to add to the chart.
|

| *engine*
| The template engine to use.
|

| *additionalFiles*
| The list of additional files to be included in the Chart archive. Any file named `README` or `LICENSE` will *always*
  be included by default.
|

| *type* / *types*
| Platform for which to generate the chart. By default this is `kubernetes`, but can be also `openshift` for using
  OpenShift specific resources in the chart. You can also add both values as a comma separated list.

  _Please note that there is no OpenShift support yet for charts, so this is experimental._
| `jkube.helm.type`

| *sourceDir*
| Where to find the resource descriptors generated with `{task-prefix}Resource`.
  By default this is `${basedir}/build/classes/java/main/classes/META-INF/jkube`, which is also the output directory used by `{task-prefix}Resource`.
| `jkube.helm.sourceDir`

| *outputDir*
| Where to create the Helm chart, which is `${basedir}/build/jkube/helm` by default for Kubernetes
  and `${basedir}/build/jkube/helmshift` for OpenShift.
| `jkube.helm.outputDir`

| *tarballOutputDir*
| Where to create the the Helm chart archive, which is `${basedir}/build` if not provided.
| `jkube.helm.tarballOutputDir`

| *chartExtension*
| The Helm chart file extension (`tgz`, `tar.bz`, `tar.bzip2`, `tar.bz2`), default value is `tar.gz` if not provided.
| `jkube.helm.chartExtension`

| *<<helm-dependencies, dependencies>>*
| The list of dependencies for this chart.
|

| *<<helm-parameters, parameters>>*
| The list of parameters to interpolate the Chart templates from the provided Fragments.

  These parameters can represent variables, in this case the values are used to generate
  the `values.yaml` file. The fragment placeholders will be replaced with a `.Values` variable.

  The parameters can also represent a Golang expression
|

[[helm-maintainers]]
.Helm Configuration - Maintainer
[cols="1,5"]
|===
| Element | Description

| *name*
| The maintainer user name or organization.

| *email*
| The maintainer's contact email address.

| *url*
| The maintainer URL address.

|===

[[helm-dependencies]]
.Helm Configuration - Dependency
[cols="1,5"]
|===
| Element | Description

| *name*
| The name of the chart dependency.

| Semantic version or version range for the dependency.

| *repository*
| URL pointing to a chart repository.

|===

[[helm-parameters]]
.Helm Configuration - Parameters
[cols="1,5"]
|===
| Element | Description

| *name*
| The name of the interpolatable parameter. Will be used to replace placeholders
  (`$\{name}`) in the provided YAML fragments. And to generate the `values.yaml` file.

| *required*
| Set to true if this is a required value (when used to generate values).

| *value*
| In case we are generating a `.Values` variable, the default value.

  In case the placeholder has to be replaced by an expression, the Golang expression
  e.g. `{{ .Chart.Name | upper }}`.

|===

In a next step you can install this via the https://github.com/helm/helm/releases[helm command line tool] as follows:

[source, sh, subs="+attributes"]
----
helm install nameForChartInRepository build/jkube/helm/${chartName}/{cluster}
----
or

[source, sh, subs="+attributes"]
----
helm install build/jkube/helm/${chartName}/{cluster} --generate-name
----

In addition, this task will also create a tar-archive below `${basedir}/build` which contains the chart with its template.
This tar is added as an artifact with classifier `helm` to the build (`helmshift` for the OpenShift mode).
