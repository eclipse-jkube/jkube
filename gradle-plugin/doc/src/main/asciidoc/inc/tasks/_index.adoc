= Tasks Overview

This plugin supports a rich set for providing a smooth Java developer experience.
These tasks can be categorized in multiple groups:

* <<tasks-build, Build and Deployment tasks>> are all about creating and managing Kubernetes build artifacts like Docker images or S2I builds.

* <<tasks-develop, Development tasks>> target help not only in developing resource descriptors to the development cluster but also to manage the lifecycle of the development cluster as well.
