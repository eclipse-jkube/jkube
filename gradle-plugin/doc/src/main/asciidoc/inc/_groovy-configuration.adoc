[cols="1,5,1"]
|====
| Element | Description | Property

| *apiVersion*
| Use this variable if you are using an older version of docker not compatible with the current default use to
communicate with the server.
| `jkube.docker.apiVersion`

 | *authConfig*
| Authentication information when pulling from or pushing to Docker registry. There is a dedicated section
  <<authentication, Authentication>> for how to do security.
|

| *access*
| Group of configuration parameters to connect to Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster.
|

| *autoPull*
a| Decide how to pull missing base images or images to start:

* `on` : Automatic download any missing images (default)
* `off` : Automatic pulling is switched off
* `always` : Pull images always even when they already exist locally
* `once` : For multi-module builds images are only checked once and pulled for the whole build.

| `jkube.docker.autoPull`

ifeval::["{task-prefix}" == "oc"]
| *buildOutputKind*
|  Allow to specify in which registry to push the container image at the end of the build.
If the output kind is ImageStreamTag, then the image will be pushed to the internal OpenShift registry.
If the output is of type DockerImage, then the name of the output reference will be used as a Docker push specification.
The default value is `ImageStreamTag`

| `jkube.build.buildOutput.kind`
endif::[]

| *buildRecreate*
a| If the effective build mode is `openshift` then this option decides how the OpenShift resource objects
associated with the build should be treated when they already exist:

* `buildConfig` or `bc` : Only the BuildConfig is recreated
* `imageStream` or `is` : Only the ImageStream is recreated
* `all` : Both, BuildConfig and ImageStream are recreated
* `none` : Neither BuildConfig nor ImageStream is recreated

The default is `none`. If you provide the property without value then `all` is assumed, so everything gets recreated.
| `jkube.build.recreate`

| *buildSourceDirectory*
| Default directory that contains the assembly descriptor(s) used by the plugin. The default value is `src/main/docker`.
This option is only relevant for the `{task-prefix}Build` task.
| `jkube.build.source.dir`

| *buildStrategy*
a| Defines what build strategy to choose while building container image.
Possible values are `docker` and `jib` out of which `docker` is default.

ifeval::["{task-prefix}" == "oc"]
If the effective build mode is `openshift` an additional `s2i` option is available
and selected by default.

Available strategies for OpenShift are:

* `s2i` for a https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/latest/architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#source-build[Source-to-Image build] with a binary source
* `docker` for a https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/latest/architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#docker-build[Docker build] with a binary source

endif::[]
| `jkube.build.strategy`

| *certPath*
| Path to SSL certificate when SSL is used for communicating with the Docker daemon. These certificates are normally
stored in `~/.docker/`. With this configuration the path can be set explicitly. If not set, the fallback is first
taken from the environment variable `DOCKER_CERT_PATH` and then as last resort `~/.docker/`. The keys in this are
expected with it standard names `ca.pem`, `cert.pem` and `key.pem`.
Please refer to the https://docs.docker.com/articles/https[Docker documentation] for more information about SSL
security with Docker.
| `jkube.docker.certPath`

| *createNewResources*
| Create new {cluster} resources.

Defaults to `true`
| `jkube.deploy.create`

| *debugSuspend*
| Disables readiness probes in Kubernetes Deployment in order to start port forwarding during early phases of application startup.

Defaults to `false`.
| `jkube.debug.suspend`

| *deletePodsOnReplicationControllerUpdate*
| Delete all the pods if we update a Replication Controller.

Defaults to `true`.
| `jkube.deploy.deletePods`

| *dockerHost*
a| The URL of the Docker Daemon. If this configuration option is not given, then the optional `<machine>` configuration
section is consulted. The scheme of the URL can be either given directly as `http` or `https`
depending on whether plain HTTP communication is enabled or SSL should
be used. Alternatively the scheme could be `tcp` in which case the
protocol is determined via the IANA assigned port: 2375 for `http`
and 2376 for `https`. Finally, Unix sockets are supported by using
the scheme `unix` together with the filesystem path to the unix socket.

The discovery sequence used by the docker-maven-plugin to determine
the URL is:

. Value of *dockerHost* (`jkube.docker.host`)
. The Docker host associated with the docker-machine named in `<machine>`, i.e. the `DOCKER_HOST` from `docker-machine env`.
. The value of the environment variable `DOCKER_HOST`.
. `unix:///var/run/docker.sock` if it is a readable socket.
| `jkube.docker.host`

| *filter*
| In order to temporarily restrict the operation of plugin tasks this configuration option can be used.
Typically this will be set via the system property `jkube.image.filter` when Gradle is called. The value can be a single
image name (either its alias or full name) or it can be a comma separated list with multiple image names. Any name
which doesn't refer an image in the configuration will be ignored.
| `jkube.image.filter`

| *failOnNoKubernetesJson*
| Fail if there is no kubernetes json present.

Defaults to `false`.
| `jkube.deploy.failOnNoKubernetesJson`

| *failOnValidationError*
| If value is set to `true` then any validation error will block the plugin execution. A warning will be printed
otherwise.

  Default is `false`.
| `jkube.failOnValidationError`

ifeval::["{task-prefix}" == "oc"]
|*forcePull*
|
Applicable only for OpenShift, S2I build strategy.

While creating a BuildConfig, By default, if the builder image specified in the
build configuration is available locally on the node, that image will be used.

Using forcePull will override the local image and refresh it from the registry the image stream points to.

|`jkube.build.forcePull`

| *ignoreRunningOAuthClients*
| Ignore OAuthClients which are already running. OAuthClients are shared across namespaces so we should not try to update or create/delete global oauth clients.

Defaults to `true`.
| `jkube.deploy.ignoreRunningOAuthClients`
endif::[]

| *ignoreServices*
| Ignore Service resources while applying resources. This is particularly useful when in recreate mode to let you easily recreate all the ReplicationControllers and Pods but leave any service definitions alone to avoid changing the portalIP addresses and breaking existing pods using the service.

Defaults to `false`.
| `jkube.deploy.ignoreServices`

| [[image-pull-policy]] *imagePullPolicy*
a| Specify whether images should be pull when looking for base images while building or images for starting.
This property can take the following values (case insensitive):

* `IfNotPresent`: Automatic download any missing images (default)
* `Never` : Automatic pulling is switched off always
* `Always` : Pull images always even when they already exist locally.

By default a progress meter is printed out on the console, which is omitted when using Maven in batch mode (option `-B`). A very simplified progress meter is provided when using no color output (i.e. with `-Djkube.useColor=false`).
| `jkube.docker.imagePullPolicy`

| *interpolateTemplateParameters*
| Interpolate parameter values from `*template.yml` fragments in the generated resource list (`kubernetes.yml`).

  This is useful when using JKube in combination with Helm.

  Placeholders for variables defined in template files can be used in the different resource fragments. Helm generated
  charts will contain these placeholders/parameters.

  For `resource` task, these placeholders are replaced in the
  aggregated resource list YAML file (not in the individual generated resources) if this option is enabled.

  Defaults to `true`.
| `jkube.interpolateTemplateParameters`

| *jsonLogDir*
| The folder we should store any temporary json files or results

Defaults to `${project.rootDir}/build/jkube/applyJson`.
| `jkube.deploy.jsonLogDir`

ifeval::["{task-prefix}" == "k8s"]

|

| *maxConnections*
| Number of parallel connections are allowed to be opened to the Docker Host. For parsing log output, a connection needs
to be kept open (as well for the wait features), so don't put that number to low. Default is 100 which should be
suitable for most of the cases.
| `jkube.docker.maxConnections`

| *mergeWithDekorate*
| When resource generation is delegated to Dekorate, should JKube resources be merged with Dekorate generated ones.

  Defaults to `false`.
| `jkube.mergeWithDekorate`

| *outputDirectory*

  Defaults to `false`.
| `jkube.offline`

ifeval::["{task-prefix}" == "oc"]
