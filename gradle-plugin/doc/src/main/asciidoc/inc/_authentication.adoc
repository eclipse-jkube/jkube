= Registry Authentication

When pulling (via the `autoPull` mode of `{task-prefix}Build`) or pushing image, it
might be necessary to authenticate against a Docker registry.

There are five different locations searched for credentials.  In order, these are:

* Providing system properties `jkube.docker.username` and `jkube.docker.password` from the outside.
* Using a `authConfig` section in the plugin configuration with `username` and `password` elements.
* Using OpenShift configuration in `~/.config/kube`
* Login into a registry with `docker login` (credentials in a credential helper or in `~/.docker/config.json`)

Using the username and password directly in the `build.gradle` is not
recommended since this is widely visible. This is the easiest and
transparent way, though. Using an `authConfig` is straight forward:

[source,groovy,subs="attributes+"]
----
{pluginExtension} {
    images {
        image {
            name = "consol/tomcat-7.0"
        }
    }
    authConfig {
        username = "jolokia"
        password = "s!cr!t"
    }
}
----

The system property provided credentials are a good compromise when
using CI servers like Jenkins. You simply provide the credentials from
the outside:

.Example
[source, sh, subs="+attributes"]
----
gradle -Djkube.docker.username=jolokia -Djkube.docker.password=s!cr!t {task-prefix}Push
----

The most _secure_ way is to rely on docker's credential store or credential helper and read confidential information
from an external credentials store, such as the native keychain of the operating system. Follow the instruction on
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/#credentials-store[the docker login documentation].

As a final fallback, this plugin consults `$DOCKER_CONFIG/config.json` if `DOCKER_CONFIG` is set, or `~/.docker/config.json` if not, and reads credentials stored directly within this
file. This unsafe behavior happened when connecting to a registry with the command `docker login` from the command line
with older versions of docker (pre 1.13.0) or when docker is not configured to use a
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/#credentials-store[credential store].

== Pull vs. Push Authentication

The credentials lookup described above is valid for both push and
pull operations. In order to narrow things down, credentials can be
provided for pull or push operations alone:

In an `authConfig` section a sub-section `pull` and/or `push`
can be added. In the example below the credentials provider are only
used for image push operations:

.Example
[source,groovy,subs="attributes+"]
----
{pluginExtension} {
    images {
        image {
            name = "consol/tomcat-7.0"
        }
    }
    authConfig {
        push {
            username = "jolokia"
            password = "secret"
        }
    }
}
----

When the credentials are given on the command line as system
properties, then the properties `jkube.docker.pull.username` /
`jkube.docker.pull.password` and `jkube.docker.push.username` /
`jkube.docker.push.password` are used for pull and push operations,
respectively (when given). Either way, the standard lookup algorithm
as described in the previous section is used as fallback.
