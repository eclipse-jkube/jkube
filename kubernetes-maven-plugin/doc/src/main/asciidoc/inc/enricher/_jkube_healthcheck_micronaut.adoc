==== jkube-healthcheck-micronaut

This enricher adds kubernetes readiness and liveness probes for Micronaut based projects.

The application should be configured as follows to enable the enricher:

[source,yaml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
endpoints:
  health:
    enabled: true
----

The enricher will try to discover the settings from the `application.properties` / `application.yaml` Micronaut configuration file.

===== Probe configuration

You can configure the different aspects of the probes.
