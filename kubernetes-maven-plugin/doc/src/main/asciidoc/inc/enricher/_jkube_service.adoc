[[jkube-service]]
==== jkube-service

This enricher is used to ensure that a service is present.
This can be either directly configured with fragments or with the XML configuration, but it can be also automatically inferred by looking at the ports exposed by an image configuration.
An explicit configuration always takes precedence over auto detection. For enriching an existing service this enricher actually works only on a configured service which matches with the configured (or inferred) service name.

The following configuration parameters can be used to influence the behaviour of this enricher:

[[enricher-jkube-service]]
.Default service enricher
[cols="1,6,1"]
|===
| Element | Description | Property

| *name*
| Service name to enrich by default. If not given here or configured elsewhere, the artifactId is used.
| `jkube.enricher.jkube-service.name`

| *headless*
| Whether a headless service without a port should be configured. A headless service has the `ClusterIP` set to `None`
  and will be only used if no ports are exposed by the image configuration or by the configuration `port`.

  Defaults to `false`.
| `jkube.enricher.jkube-service.headless`

| *expose*
| If set to true, a label `expose` with value `true` is added which can be picked up by the jkube.
  https://github.com/jenkins-x/exposecontroller[expose-controller] to expose the service to the outside by various means.
  See the documentation of expose-controller for more details.

  Defaults to `false`.
| `jkube.enricher.jkube-service.expose`

| *type*
| Kubernetes / OpenShift service type to set like _LoadBalancer_, _NodePort_ or _ClusterIP_.
| `jkube.enricher.jkube-service.type`

| *port*
| The service port to use. By default the same port as the ports exposed in the image configuration is used, but can be
  changed with this parameter. See <<jkube-service-ports,below>> for a detailed description of the format which can be
  put into this variable.
| `jkube.enricher.jkube-service.port`

| *multiPort*
| Set this to `true` if you want all ports to be exposed from an image configuration. Otherwise only the first port is
  used as a service port.

  Defaults to `false`.
| `jkube.enricher.jkube-service.multiPort`

| *protocol*
| Default protocol to use for the services. Must be `tcp` or `udp`.

  Defaults to `tcp`.
| `jkube.enricher.jkube-service.protocol`

| *normalizePort*
| Normalize the port numbering of the service to common and conventional port numbers.

  Defaults to `false`.
| `jkube.enricher.jkube-service.normalizePort`
|===


Following is the Port mapping that comes in effect, when normalizePort option is set true.

| Original Port | Normalized Port

| 8181 | 80
| 8180 | 80

You specify the properties like for any enricher within the enrichers configuration like in

.Example
[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
-----
<configuration>
  <!-- ... -->
  <enricher>
    <config>
      <jkube-service>
        <name>my-service</name>
        <type>NodePort</type>
        <multiPort>true</multiPort>
      </jkube-service>
    </config>
  </enricher>
</configuration>

[[jkube-service-ports]]
.Port specification

With the option `port` you can influence the mapping how ports are mapped from the pod to the service.
By default and if this option is not given the ports exposed are dictated by the ports exposed from the Docker images contained in the pods.
Remember, each image configured can be part of the pod.
However you can expose also completely different ports as the images meta data declare.

The property `port` can contain a comma separated list of mappings of the following format:

[source,text,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
-----
<servicePort1>:<targetPort1>/<protocol>,<servicePort2>:<targetPort2>/<protocol>,....
-----

where the `targetPort` and `<protocol>` specification is optional. These ports are overlayed over the ports exposed by the images, in the given order.

This is best explained by some examples.

For example if you have a pod which exposes a Microservice on port 8080 and you want to expose it as a service on port 80 (so that it can be accessed with `http://myservice`)  you can simply use the following enricher configuration:

.Example
[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
-----
<configuration>
  <enricher>
    <config>
      <jkube-service>
        <name>myservice</name>
        <port>80:8080</port> <!--1-->
      </jkube-service>
    </config>
  </enricher>
</configuration>
-----
<1> 80 is the service port, 8080 the port opened in from the pod's images

If your pod _exposes_ their ports (which e.g. all generator do), then you can even omit the 8080 here (i.e. `<port>80</port>`).
In this case the _first_ port exposed will be mapped to port 80, all other exposed ports will be omitted.

By default an automatically generated service only exposes the first port, even when more ports are exposed.
When you want to map multiple ports you need to set the config option `<multiPort>true</multiPort>`.
In this case you can also provide multiple mappings as a comma separated list in the `<port>` specification where each element of the list are the mapping for the first, second, ... port.

A more (and bit artificially constructed) specification could be `<port>80,9779:9779/udp,443</port>`.
Assuming that the image exposes ports `8080` and `8778` (either directly or via <<generators,generators>>) and we have switched on multiport mode, then the following service port mappings will be performed for the automatically generated service:

* Pod port 8080 is mapped to service port 80.
* Pod port 9779 is mapped to service port 9779 with protocol UDP. Note how this second entry overrides the pod exposed port 8778.
* Pod port 443 is mapped to service port 443.

This example shows also the mapping rules:

* Port specification in `port` always override the port metadata of the contained Docker images (i.e. the ports exposed)
* You can always provide a complete mapping with `port` on your own
* The ports exposed by the images serve as _default values_ which are used if not specified by this configuration option.
* You can map ports which are _not_ exposed by the images by specifying them as target ports.

Multiple ports are **only** mapped when _multiPort_ mode is enabled (which is switched off by default). If _multiPort_ mode is disabled, only the first port from the list of mapped ports calculated as above is taken.

When you set `legacyPortMapping` to true than ports 8080 to 9090 are mapped to port 80 automatically if not explicitly mapped via `_port_`. I.e. when an image exposes port 8080 with a legacy mapping this mapped to a service port 80, not 8080. You _should not_ switch this on for any good reason. In fact it might be that this option can vanish anytime.
