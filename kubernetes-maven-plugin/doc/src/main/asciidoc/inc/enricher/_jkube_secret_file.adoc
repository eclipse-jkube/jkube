==== jkube-secret-file

This enricher adds Secret defined as file content from an annotation.

If you are defining a custom `Secret` file, you can use an annotation to define a file name as key and its content as the value:

[source, yaml]
----
metadata:
  name: ${project.artifactId}
  annotations:
    maven.jkube.io/secret/application.properties: src/test/resources/test-application.properties
----

This creates a `Secret` data with the key `application.properties` (part defined after `secret`) and value content of
`src/test/resources/test-application.properties` file (base64 encoded).
