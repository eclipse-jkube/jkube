[[k8s:helm]]
== *k8s:helm*

This goal is for creating
https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts[Helm charts]
for your Maven project so that you can install, update or delete your app in Kubernetes
using https://github.com/helm/helm[Helm].

For creating a Helm chart you simply call `k8s:helm` goal on the command line:

[source, sh]
----
mvn k8s:resource k8s:helm
----

The `k8s:resource` goal is required to create the resource descriptors which are included in the Helm chart.
If you have already built the resource then you can omit this goal.

The configuration is defined in a `<helm>` section within the plugin's configuration:

.Example Helm configuration
[source, xml]
----
<plugin>
  <configuration>
    <helm>
      <chart>Jenkins</chart>
      <keywords>ci,cd,server</keywords>
    </helm>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
----

This configuration section knows the following sub-elements in order to configure your Helm chart.

.Helm configuration
[cols="1,5,1"]
|===
| Element | Description | Property

| *chart*
| The Chart name, which is `${project.artifactId}` if not provided.
| `jkube.helm.chart`

| *version*
| The Chart SemVer version, which is `${project.version}` if not provided.
| `jkube.helm.version`

| *description*
| The Chart single-sentence description, which is `${project.description}` if not provided.
| `jkube.helm.description`

| *home*
| The Chart URL for this project's home page, which is `${project.url}` if not provided.
| `jkube.helm.home`

| *sources*
| The Chart list of URLs to source code for this project, defaults to the list of `${project.scm.url}` if not provided.
|

| *maintainers*
| The Chart list of maintainers (name+email), defaults to the list of
  `${project.developers.name}:${project.developers.name}`if not provided.
|

| *icon*
| The Chart URL to an SVG or PNG image to be used as an icon, default is extracted from the kubernetes manifest
  (`kubernetes.yml`) `jkube.io/iconUrl` annotation if not provided.
| `jkube.helm.icon`

| *keywords*
| Comma separated list of keywords to add to the chart.
|

| *engine*
| The template engine to use.
|

| *additionalFiles*
| The list of additional files to be included in the Chart archive. Any file named `README` or `LICENSE` will *always*
  be included by default.
|

| *type* / *types*
| Platform for which to generate the chart. By default this is `kubernetes`, but can be also `openshift` for using
  OpenShift specific resources in the chart. You can also add both values as a comma separated list.

  _Please note that there is no OpenShift support yet for charts, so this is experimental._
| `jkube.helm.type`

| *sourceDir*
| Where to find the resource descriptors generated with `k8s:resource`.
  By default this is `${basedir}/target/classes/META-INF/jkube., which is also the output directory used by `k8s:resource`.
| `jkube.helm.sourceDir`

| *outputDir*
| Where to create the Helm chart, which is `${basedir}/target/jkube/helm` by default for Kubernetes
  and `${basedir}/target/jkube/helmshift` for OpenShift.
| `jkube.helm.outputDir`

| *tarballOutputDir*
| Where to create the the Helm chart archive, which is `${basedir}/target` if not provided.
| `jkube.helm.tarballOutputDir`

| *chartExtension*
| The Helm chart file extension (`tgz`, `tar.bz`, `tar.bzip2`, `tar.bz2`), default value is `tar.gz` if not provided.
| `jkube.helm.chartExtension`
|

In a next step you can install this via the https://github.com/helm/helm/releases[helm command line tool] as follows:

[source, sh]
----
helm install nameForChartInRepository target/jkube/helm/${chartName}/kubernetes
----
or
----
helm install target/jkube/helm/${chartName}/kubernetes --generate-name
----

To add the `helm` goal to your project so that it is automatically executed just add the `helm` goal to the `executions`
section of the `kubernetes-maven-plugin` section of your `pom.xml`.

.Add helm goal
[source, xml, indent=0]
----
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.eclipse.jkube</groupId>
  <artifactId>kubernetes-maven-plugin</artifactId>

  <!-- ... -->

  <executions>
    <execution>
      <goals>
        <goal>resource</goal>
        <goal>helm</goal>
        <goal>build</goal>
        <goal>deploy</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
----

In addition this goal will also create a tar-archive below `${basedir}/target` which contains the chart with its template.
This tar is added as an artifact with classifier `helm` to the build (`helmshift` for the OpenShift mode).
