[[jkube:resource]]
== *{goal-prefix}:resource*

This goal generates {cluster} resources based on your project. It can either be opinionated defaults or
based on the configuration provided in XML config or resource fragments in `src/main/jkube`.
ifeval::["{goal-prefix}" == "k8s"]
Generated resources are in `target/classes/META-INF/jkube/kubernetes` directory.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{goal-prefix}" == "oc"]
Generated resources are in `target/classes/META-INF/jkube/openshift` directory.
endif::[]

=== Supported Properties for Resource goal

.Options available with resource goal
[cols="1,6,1"]
|===
| Element | Description | Property

| *profile*
| Profile to use. A profile contains the enrichers and generators to use as well as their configuration. Profiles are
  looked up in the classpath and can be provided as yaml files.

  Defaults to `default`.
| `jkube.profile`

| *sidecar*
| Whether to enable sidecar behavior or not. By default pod specs are merged into main application container.

  Defaults to `false`.
| `jkube.sidecar`

| *skipHealthCheck*
| Whether to skip health checks addition in generated resources or not.

  Defaults to `false`.
| `jkube.skipHealthCheck`

| *workDir*
| The JKube working directory where resource fragments are temporarily processed before being merged into final resources. Defaults to `${project.build.directory}/jkube-temp`.

  NOTE: This directory is automatically cleaned at the start of each resource processing run to prevent stale files from previous builds from being incorrectly merged with current fragments.
| `jkube.workDir`

| *environment*
| Environment name where resources are placed. For example, if you set this property to dev and resourceDir is the
  default one, plugin will look at `src/main/jkube/dev`.  Multiple environments can also be provided in form of comma separated strings (e.g., `common,dev`).

  When multiple environments are specified, resource fragments are processed and merged as follows:

  *Processing Steps:*

  . Fragments from all specified environment directories are collected (in order)
  . Working directory is cleaned to remove stale files
  . Each fragment is interpolated with Maven/project properties
  . Fragments with the same filename are merged using Jackson YAML updater

  *Merge Behavior for YAML Files:*

  * *Objects/Maps*: Properties are deeply merged at all levels - new properties are added, existing properties are updated recursively
  * *Arrays/Lists*: Elements from the new fragment are appended to the existing list
  * *Scalar Values*: New values replace existing values

  *Example Use Case:*

  Given `common/deployment.yml`:
  ```yaml
  spec:
    replicas: 2
    template:
      spec:
        containers:
          - env:
              - name: SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE
                value: common
  ```

  And `dev/deployment.yml`:
  ```yaml
  metadata:
    labels:
      environment: development
  spec:
    replicas: 1
    template:
      spec:
        containers:
          - env:
              - name: LOG_LEVEL
                value: DEBUG
  ```

  The merged result will be:
  ```yaml
  metadata:
    labels:
      environment: development                    # from dev
  spec:
    replicas: 1                                   # from dev (overrides common)
    template:
      spec:
        containers:
          - env:
              - name: SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE      # from common
                value: common
              - name: LOG_LEVEL                   # from dev (appended to list)
                value: DEBUG
  ```

  Defaults to `null`.
| `jkube.environment`

| *useProjectClassPath*
| Should we use the project's compile time classpath to scan for additional enrichers/generators.

  Defaults to `false`.
| `jkube.useProjectClassPath`

| *resourceDir*
| Folder where to find project specific files.

  Defaults to `${basedir}/src/main/jkube`.
| `jkube.resourceDir`

| *targetDir*
| The generated Kubernetes manifests target direcotry.

  Defaults to `${project.build.outputDirectory}/META-INF/jkube`.
| `jkube.targetDir`

| *resourceType*
| The artifact type for attaching the generated resource file to the project. Can be either 'json' or 'yaml'.

  Defaults to `yaml`.
| `jkube.resourceType`

| *mergeWithDekorate*
| When resource generation is delegated to Dekorate, should JKube resources be merged with Dekorate generated ones.

  Defaults to `false`.
| `jkube.mergeWithDekorate`

| *interpolateTemplateParameters*
| Interpolate parameter values from `*template.yml` fragments in the generated resource list (`kubernetes.yml`).

  This is useful when using JKube in combination with Helm.

  Placeholders for variables defined in template files can be used in the different resource fragments. Helm generated
  charts will contain these placeholders/parameters.

  For `resource` goal, these placeholders are replaced in the
  aggregated resource list YAML file (not in the individual generated resources) if this option is enabled.

  Defaults to `true`.
| `jkube.interpolateTemplateParameters`

| *skipResource*
| Skip resource generation.

  Defaults to `false`.
| `jkube.skip.resource`

| *createExternalUrls*
| Should we create external Ingress for any LoadBalancer Services which don't already have them.

  Defaults to `false`.
| `jkube.createExternalUrls`

| *domain*
| Domain added to the Service ID when creating Kubernetes Ingresses or OpenShift routes.
| `jkube.domain`

| *replicas*
| Number of replicas for the container.
|

| *offline*
| Whether to try detecting Kubernetes Cluster or stay offline.

  Defaults to `false`.
| `jkube.offline`
