[[k8s:resource]]
== *k8s:resource*

This goal generates kubernetes resources based upon your project. It can either be opinionated defaults or
based upon the configuration provided in XML config or resource fragments in `src/main/jkube`. Generated
resources are in `target/classes/META-INF/jkube/kubernetes` directory.

[[resource-labels-annotations]]
=== Labels and Annotations

Labels and annotations can be easily added to any resource object. This is best explained by an example.

----
<1> `<labels>` section with `<resources>` contains labels which should be applied to objects of various kinds
<2> Within `<all>` labels which should be applied to *every* object can be specified
<3> `<service>` labels are used to label services
<4> `<replicaSet>` labels are for replica set and replication controller
<5> `<pod>` holds labels for pod specifications in replication controller, replica sets and deployments
<6> `<deployment>` is for labels on deployments (kubernetes) and deployment configs (openshift)
<7> The subelements are also available for specifying annotations.
<8> `<remotes>` you can set location of fragments as `URL`.

Labels and annotations can be specified in free form as a map. In this map the element name is the name of the label or annotation respectively, whereas the content is the value to set.

The following subelements are possible for `<labels>` and `<annotations>` :

.Label and annotation configuration
[cols="1,6"]
|===
| Element | Description

| *all*
| All entries specified in the `<all>` sections are applied to all resource objects created. This also implies build object like image stream and build configs which are create implicitely for an <<build-openshift, OpenShift build>>.

| *deployment*
| Labels and annotations applied to `Deployment` (for Kubernetes) and `DeploymentConfig` (for OpenShift) objects


| *pod*
| Labels and annotations applied pod specification as used in `ReplicationController`,  `ReplicaSets`, `Deployments` and `DeploymentConfigs` objects.


| *replicaSet*
| Labels and annotations applied to `ReplicaSet` and `ReplicationController` objects.

| *service*
| Labels and annotations applied to `Service` objects.

[[resource-secrets]]
=== Secrets


Once you've configured some docker registry credentials into `~/.m2/setting.xml`, as explained in the
<<authentication, Authentication>> section, you can create Kubernetes secrets from a server declaration.

**XML configuration**


You can create a secret using xml configuration in the `pom.xml` file. It should contain the following fields:

[cols="1,1,6"]
|===
|key |required |description

|**dockerServerId**
|`true`
|the server id which is configured in
`~/.m2/setting.xml`

|**name**
|`true`
|this will be used as name of the kubernetes secret resource

|**namespace**
|`false`
|the secret resource will be applied to the specific
namespace, if provided
|===

This is best explained by an example.

.Example for XML configuration

[source,xml]
----
<properties>
    <docker.registry>docker.io</docker.registry>
</properties>
...
<configuration>
    <resources>
        <secrets>
            <secret>
                <dockerServerId>${docker.registry}</dockerServerId>
                <name>mydockerkey</name>
            </secret>
        </secrets>
    </resources>
</configuration>
----

**Yaml fragment with annotation**


You can create a secret using a yaml fragment. You can reference the docker server id with an annotation
`maven.jkube.io/dockerServerId`. The yaml fragment file should be put under
the `src/main/jkube/` folder.

.Example

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mydockerkey
  namespace: default
  annotations:
    maven.jkube.io/dockerServerId: ${docker.registry}
type: kubernetes.io/dockercfg
----

[[resource-validation]]
=== Resource Validation
Resource goal also validates the generated resource descriptors using API specification of https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/master/api/openapi-spec/swagger.json[Kubernetes].

.Validation Configuration
[cols="1,6,1"]
|===
| Configuration | Description | Default

| *jkube.skipResourceValidation*
| If value is set to `true` then resource validation is skipped. This may be useful if resource validation is failing for some reason but you still want to continue the deployment.
| `false`

| *jkube.failOnValidationError*
| If value is set to `true` then any validation error will block the plugin execution. A warning will be printed otherwise.
| `false`

|===

[[resource-route-generation]]
=== Route Generation

When the `k8s:resource` goal is run, an OpenShift https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/networking/routes.html[Route] descriptor (`route.yml`) will also be generated along the service if an OpenShift cluster is targeted. 
If you do not want to generate a Route descriptor, you can set the `jkube.openshift.generateRoute` property to `false`.

.Route Generation Configuration
[cols="1.6.1"]
|===
| Configuration | Description | Default

| *jkube.openshift.generateRoute*
| If value is set to `false` then no Route descriptor will be generated. By default it is set to `true`, which will create a `route.yml` descriptor and also add Route resource to `openshift.yml`.
| `true`
|===

If you do not want to generate a Route descriptor, you can also specify so in the plugin configuration in your POM as seen below.

.Example for not generating route resource by configuring it in `pom.xml`

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.eclipse.jkube</groupId>
    <artifactId>k8s-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>{version}</version>
    <configuration>
        <generateRoute>false</generateRoute>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----

If you are using resource fragments, then also you can configure it in your Service resource fragment (e.g. `service.yml`). You need to add an `expose` label to the `metadata` section of your service and set it to `false`.

.Example for not generating route resource by configuring it in resource fragments

[source.yaml]
----
metadata:
  annotations:
    api.service.kubernetes.io/path: /hello
  labels:
    expose: "false"
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
----

In case both the label and the property have been set with conflicting values, precedence will be given to the property value, so if you set the label to `true` but set the property to `false` then no Route descriptor will be generated because precedence will be given to the property value.

.Other options available with resource goal
[cols="1.6.3"]
|===
