[[jkube:helm-push]]
== *{goal-prefix}:helm*

This goal is for pushing
https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts[Helm charts]
in a remote repository [Artifactory, Chartmuseum, Nexus].

To publish a Helm chart you simply call `{goal-prefix}:helm-push` goal on the command line:

[source, sh, subs="+attributes"]
----
mvn {goal-prefix}:resource {goal-prefix}:helm {goal-prefix}:helm-push
----

The `{goal-prefix}:resource` and the `{goal-prefix}:helm` goals are required to create the resource descriptors which are included in the Helm chart and the Helm chart itself.
If you have already built the resource and create the chart, then you can omit these goals.

The configuration is defined in a `<helm>` section within the plugin's configuration:

.Example Helm configuration
