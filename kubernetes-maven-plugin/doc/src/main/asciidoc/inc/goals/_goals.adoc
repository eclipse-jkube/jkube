= Goals Overview

This plugin supports a rich set for providing a smooth Java developer experience. These goals can be categorized in multiple groups:

* <<goals-build, Build goals>> are all about creating and managing Kubernetes build artifacts like Docker images or S2I builds.

* <<goals-develop, Development goals>> target help not only in deploying resource descriptors to the development cluster but also to manage the lifecycle of the development cluster as well.

[[goals-build]]
.Build Goals
[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Goal | Description

| *<<jkube:build>>*
| Build images

| *<<jkube:push>>*
| Push images to a registry

| *<<jkube:resource>>*
| Create Kubernetes or OpenShift resource descriptors

| *<<jkube:apply>>*
| Apply resources to a running cluster
|===

[[goals-develop]]
.Development Goals
[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Goal | Description

| *<<jkube:deploy>>*
| Deploy resources descriptors to a cluster after creating them and building the app. Same as <<jkube:apply>> except that it runs in the background.

| *<<jkube:undeploy>>*
| Undeploy and remove resources descriptors from a cluster.

| *<<jkube:log>>*
| Show the logs of the running application

| *<<jkube:debug>>*
| Enable remote debugging.

| <<jkube:remote-dev>>
| Start a remote development session.

| *<<jkube:watch>>*
| Watch for file changes and perform rebuilds and redeployments.

Depending on whether the OpenShift or Kubernetes operational mode is used, the workflow and the performed actions differs :

.Workflows
[cols="1,4,4"]
|===
| Use Case | Kubernetes | OpenShift

| Build
a| `{goal-prefix}:build` `{goal-prefix}:push`

* Creates an image against an exposed Docker daemon (with a `docker.tar`)
* Pushes the image to a registry which is then referenced from the configuration

a| `{goal-prefix}:build`

* Creates or uses a `BuildConfig`
* Creates or uses an `ImageStream` which can be referenced by the deployment descriptors in a `DeploymenConfig`
* Starts an OpenShift build with a `docker.tar` as input


| Deploy
a| `{goal-prefix}:deploy`

* Applies a Kubernetes resource descriptor to cluster

a| `{goal-prefix}:deploy`

* Applies an OpenShift resource descriptor to a cluster
