| Element | Description

| <<image-name, *name*>>
| Each `<image>` configuration has a mandatory, unique docker
repository _name_. This can include registry and tag parts, but also placeholder parameters. See below for a detailed explanation.

| *alias*
| Shortcut name for an image which can be used for
identifying the image within this configuration. This is used when
linking images together or for specifying it with the global *image* configuration element.

| <<registry, *registry*>>
| Registry to use for this image. If the `name` already contains a registry this takes precedence. See <<registry,Registry handling>> for more details.

| <<config-image-build, *build*>>
| Element which contains all the configuration aspects when doing a <<jkube:build>>. This element can be omitted if the image is only pulled from a registry e.g. as support for integration tests like database images.
