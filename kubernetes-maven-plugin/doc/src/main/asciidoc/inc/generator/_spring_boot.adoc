[[generator-spring-boot]]
=== Spring Boot

This generator is called `spring-boot` and gets activated when it finds a `spring-boot-maven-plugin` in the pom.xml.

This generator is based on the <<generator-java-exec, Java Application>> Generator and inherits all of its configuration values. The generated container port is read from the `server.port` property `application.properties`, defaulting to `8080` if it is not found. It also uses the same default images as the <<generator-java-exec-from, java-exec Generator>>.

Beside the  <<generator-options-common, common generator options>> and the <<generator-java-exec-options, java-exec options>> the following additional configuration is recognized:

The generator adds Kubernetes liveness and readiness probes pointing to either the management or server port as read from the `application.properties`.
If the `management.port` (for Spring Boot 1) or `management.server.port` (for Spring Boot 2) and `management.ssl.key-store` (for Spring Boot 1) or `management.server.ssl.key-store` (for Spring Boot 2) properties are set in `application.properties` otherwise or `server.ssl.key-store` property is set in `application.properties` then the probes are automatically set to use `https`.

The generator works differently when called together with `{goal-prefix}:watch`.
In that case it enables support for http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using-boot-devtools.html[Spring Boot Developer Tools] which allows for hot reloading of the Spring Boot app.
In particular, the following steps are performed:

* If a secret token is not provided within the Spring Boot application configuration `application.properties` or `application.yml` with the key `spring.devtools.remote.secret` then a custom secret token is created and added to `application.properties`
* Add `spring-boot-devtools.jar` as `BOOT-INF/lib/spring-devtools.jar` to the spring-boot fat jar.

Since during `{goal-prefix}:watch` the application itself within the `target/` directory is modified for allowing easy reloading you must ensure that you do a `mvn clean` before building an artifact which should be put into production.
Since the released version are typically generated with a CI system which does a clean build anyway this should be only a theoretical problem.
