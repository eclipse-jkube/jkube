[[generator-karaf]]
=== Karaf

This generator named `karaf` kicks in when the build uses a `karaf-maven-plugin`. By default the following base images are used:

[[generator-karaf-from]]
.Karaf Base Images
[cols="1,4,4,4"]
|===
| | Docker Build | S2I Build | ImageStream

| *Community*
| `quay.io/jkube/jkube-karaf-binary-s2i`
| `quay.io/jkube/jkube-karaf-binary-s2i`
| `jkube-karaf`

|===

When a `fromMode` of `istag` is used to specify an `ImageStreamTag` and when no `from` is given, then as default the
`ImageStreamTag` `jkube-karaf` in the namespace `openshift` is chosen.

In addition to the  <<generator-options-common, common generator options>> this generator can be configured with the following options:

.Karaf configuration options

| Element | Description | Default

| *baseDir*
| Directory within the generated image where to put the detected artefacts into. Change this only if the base image is changed, too.
| `/deployments`

| *jolokiaPort*
| Port of the Jolokia agent exposed by the base image. Set this to 0 if you don't want to expose the Jolokia port.
| 8778

| *mainClass*
| Main class to call. If not given first a check is performed to detect a fat-jar (see above). Next a class is tried to be found by scanning `target/classes` for a single class with a main method. If no if found or more than one is found, then this generator does nothing.
|

| *user*
| User and/or group under which the files should be added. The syntax of this options is descriped in <<config-image-build-assembly-user, Assembly Configuration>>.
| `jboss:jboss:jboss`

| *webPort*
| Port to expose as service, which is supposed to be the port of a web application. Set this to 0 if you don't want to expose a port.
