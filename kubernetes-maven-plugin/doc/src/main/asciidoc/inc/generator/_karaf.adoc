[[generator-karaf]]
=== Karaf

This generator named `karaf` kicks in when the build uses a `karaf-maven-plugin`. By default the following base images are used:

[[generator-karaf-from]]
.Karaf Base Images
[cols="1,4,4,4"]
|===
| | Docker Build | S2I Build | ImageStream

| *Community*
| `quay.io/jkube/jkube-karaf-binary-s2i`
| `quay.io/jkube/jkube-karaf-binary-s2i`
| `jkube-karaf`

|===

When a `fromMode` of `istag` is used to specify an `ImageStreamTag` and when no `from` is given, then as default the
`ImageStreamTag` `jkube-karaf` in the namespace `openshift` is chosen.

In addition to the  <<generator-options-common, common generator options>> this generator can be configured with the following options:
