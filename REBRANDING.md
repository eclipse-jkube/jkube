# Where did Eclipse JKube come from?

This project was earlier called [Fabric8 Maven Plugin](https://github.com/fabric8io/fabric8-maven-plugin) which was an essential component of [Fabric8](http://fabric8.io/) project which was an end to end development platform for building, testing and deploying your applications using it's pipelines. However, project was not successful and it was finally archived. However, there were still some projects inside that org which were still relevant and made sense in as general purpose tool/library. We have provided more background in this [RedHat Developer blogpost](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/01/28/introduction-to-eclipse-jkube-java-tooling-for-kubernetes-and-red-hat-openshift/#Background)

The only difference between Fabric8 Maven Plugin and Eclipse JKube is separation of concerns. Fabric8 Maven Plugin used to create resource manifests for both Kubernetes and OpenShift clusters but Eclipse JKube has two different plugins for this task. We have also refactored core Enricher and Generator apis into JKube Kit.

## Appreciating Fabric8 Maven Plugin Authors and Contributors

We as the maintaining team of Fabric8 Maven Plugin felt the need to refactor/rebrand it as a general purpose maven plugin so that any Java developer can use it for his/her Kubernetes/OpenShift workloads. But it must be noted that this project is a result of the hard work being put by Fabric8 Maven Plugin authors and contributors.
