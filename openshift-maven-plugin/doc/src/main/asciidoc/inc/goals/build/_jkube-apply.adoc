[[oc:apply]]
== *oc:apply*

This goal applies the resources created with <<oc:resource>> to a connected Kubernetes cluster. It's  similar to <<oc:deploy>> but does not the full deployment cycle of creating the resource, creating the application image and sending the resource descriptors to the clusters. This goal can be easily bound to `<executions>` within the plugin's configuration and binds by default to the `install` lifecycle phase.
