=== Controller Generation

In JKube terminology, a Controller resource is a Kubernetes resource which manages Pods created for your application. These can be one of the following resources:


* https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicationcontroller/[ReplicationController]
* https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/[ReplicaSet]
* https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/[Deployment]
* https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/[StatefulSet]
* https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/[DaemonSet]
* https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/[Job]
ifeval::["{task-prefix}" == "oc"]
* https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/applications/deployments/what-deployments-are.html#deployments-and-deploymentconfigs_what-deployments-are[DeploymentConfig]
endif::[]

By default, Deployment is generated in Kubernetes mode. You can easily configure different aspects of generated Controller resource using {plugin-configuration-type} configuration. Here is an example:

ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "maven"]
include::maven/_controller_resource_configuration_example.adoc[]
endif::[]
ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "gradle"]
include::gradle/_controller_resource_configuration_example.adoc[]
endif::[]

ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "maven"]
Here are the fields available in `resources` {plugin-configuration-type} configuration that would work with {goal-prefix}:resource:

ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "gradle"]

.resources fields for configuring generated controllers
[cols="1,5"]
|===
| Element | Description

| `env`
| Environment variables which will be added to containers in Pod template spec.

| <<volume-resource-configuration, `volumes`>>
| Configuration element for adding volume mounts to containers in Pod template spec

| `controllerName`
| Name of the controller resource(i.e. `Deployment`, `ReplicaSet`, `StatefulSet` etc) generated

| <<probe-resources-configuration, `liveness`>>
| Configuration element for adding a liveness probe

| <<probe-resources-configuration, `readiness`>>
| Configuration element for adding readiness probe

| `containerPrivileged`
| Run container in privileged mode. Sets `privileged: true` in generated Controller's PodTemplateSpec

| `imagePullPolicy`
| How images should be pulled (maps to ImagePullPolicy).

| `replicas`
| Number of replicas to create

| `restartPolicy`
| Pod's restart policy.

For `Job`, this defaults to `OnFailure`. For others, it's not provided ({cluster} assumes it to be `Always`)

| `serviceAccount`
| ServiceAccount name which will be used by pods created by controller resources(e.g. `Deployment`, `ReplicaSet` etc)
