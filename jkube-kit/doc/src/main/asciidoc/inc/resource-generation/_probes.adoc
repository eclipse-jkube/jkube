=== Probe Configuration
Probe configuration is used for configuring https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/#configure-probes[liveness and readiness probes] for containers. Both `liveness` and `readiness` probes the following options:

.{plugin-configuration-type} Probe configuration
[cols="1,5"]
|===
| Element | Description

| `initialDelaySeconds`
| Initial delay in seconds before the probe is started.

| `timeoutSeconds`
| Timeout in seconds how long the probe might take.

| `exec`
| Command to execute for probing.

| `getUrl`
| Probe URL for HTTP Probe. Configures HTTP probe fields like `host`, `scheme`, `path` etc by parsing URL. For example, a `getUrl = "http://:8080/health"` would result in probe generated with fields set like this:

  host: ""

  path: /health

  port: 8080

  scheme: HTTP

Host name with empty value defaults to Pod IP. You probably want to set "Host" in httpHeaders instead.

| `tcpPort`
| TCP port to probe.

| `failureThreshold`
| When a probe fails, Kubernetes will try failureThreshold times before giving up

| `successThreshold`
|  Minimum consecutive successes for the probe to be considered successful after having failed.

|  `httpHeaders`
| Custom headers to set in the request.

| `periodSeconds`
| How often in seconds to perform the probe. Defaults to 10 seconds. Minimum value is 1.
