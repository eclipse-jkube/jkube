There are some configuration options which are shared by all generators:

| Element | Description | Property

| *add*
| When set to `true`, then the generator _adds_ to an existing image configuration. By default this is disabled, so
  that a generator only kicks in when there are no other image configurations in the build, which are either configured directly for a
ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "maven"]
`{goal-prefix}:build`
endif::[]
ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "gradle"]
`{task-prefix}Build`
endif::[]
or already added by a generator which has been run previously.
| `jkube.generator.add`

| *alias*
| An alias name for referencing this image in various other parts of the configuration. This is also used in the log
  output. The default alias name is the name of the generator.
| `jkube.generator.alias`

| *from*
| This is the base image from where to start when creating the images. By default, the generators make an opinionated
  decision for the base image which are described in the respective generator section.
| `jkube.generator.from`

| *fromMode*
| Whe using OpenShift S2I builds the base image can be either a plain docker image (mode: `jib`) or a reference to an
  https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.3/architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html[ ImageStreamTag]
  (mode: `istag`). In the case of an ImageStreamTag, `from` has to be specified in the form `namespace/image-stream:tag`.
  The mode takes only effect when running in OpenShift mode.
| `jkube.generator.fromMode`

| *name*
| The Docker image name used when doing Docker builds. For OpenShift S2I builds its the name of the image stream. This
  can be a pattern as described in <<image-name, Name Placeholders>>. The default is `%g/%a:%l`. Note that this flag would only work
  when you're using opinionated image configuration provided by generators. if generators are not applicable for your project configuration, this
  flag won't work.
| `jkube.generator.name`

| *registry*
| A optional Docker registry used when doing Docker builds. It has no effect for OpenShift S2I builds.
| `jkube.generator.registry`

When used as properties they can be directly referenced with the property names above.
