| Element | Description | Property

| <<image-name, *name*>>
| Each `image` configuration has a mandatory, unique docker repository _name_.
  This can include registry and tag parts, but also placeholder parameters.
  See below for a detailed explanation.
| `jkube.container-image.name`

| *alias*
| Shortcut name for an image which can be used for identifying the image within this configuration.
  This is used when linking images together or for specifying it with the global *image* configuration element.
| `jkube.container-image.alias`

| <<registry, *registry*>>
| Registry to use for this image. If the `name` already contains a registry this takes precedence. See <<registry,Registry handling>> for more details.
| `jkube.container-image.registry`

| <<config-image-build, *build*>>
|
ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "maven"]
Element which contains all the configuration aspects when doing a <<jkube:build, {goal-prefix}:build>>.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "gradle"]
Element which contains all the configuration aspects when doing a <<jkubeBuild, {task-prefix}Build>>.
endif::[]

  This element can be omitted if the image is only pulled from a registry.
  e.g. as support for integration tests like database images.
|

| *propertyResolverPrefix*
| Prefix for property resolution. This is used to resolve properties in the configuration.
  If not set, the default prefix is `jkube.container-image`.
