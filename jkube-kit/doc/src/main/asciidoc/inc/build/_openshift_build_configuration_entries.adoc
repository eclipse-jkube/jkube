|*forcePull*
|
Applicable only for OpenShift, S2I build strategy.

While creating a BuildConfig, By default, if the builder image specified in the
build configuration is available locally on the node, that image will be used.

Using forcePull will override the local image and refresh it from the registry the image stream points to.

|`jkube.build.forcePull`

| *openshiftPullSecret*
| The name to use for naming pullSecret to be created to pull the base image in case pulling from a private registry
which requires authentication for OpenShift.

  The default value for pull registry will be picked from `jkube.docker.pull.registry`/`jkube.docker.registry`.
| `jkube.build.pullSecret`

| *openshiftPushSecret*
| The name of pushSecret to be used to push the final image in case pushing from a
protected registry which requires authentication.

| `jkube.build.pushSecret`

| *buildOutputKind*
|  Allow to specify in which registry to push the container image at the end of the build.
If the output kind is ImageStreamTag, then the image will be pushed to the internal OpenShift registry.
If the output is of type DockerImage, then the name of the output reference will be used as a Docker push specification.
The default value is `ImageStreamTag`

| `jkube.build.buildOutput.kind`


| *buildRecreate*
a| If the build is performed in an OpenShift cluster then this option decides how the OpenShift resource objects
associated with the build should be treated when they already exist:

* `buildConfig` or `bc` : Only the BuildConfig is recreated
* `imageStream` or `is` : Only the ImageStream is recreated
* `all` : Both, BuildConfig and ImageStream are recreated
* `none` : Neither BuildConfig nor ImageStream is recreated

The default is `none`. If you provide the property without value then `all` is assumed, so everything gets recreated.
