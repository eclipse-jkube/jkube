| *buildStrategy*
a| Defines what build strategy to choose while building container image.
Possible values are `docker`, `buildpacks` and `jib` out of which `docker` is default.

| `jkube.build.strategy`

| *buildSourceDirectory*
| Default directory that contains the assembly descriptor(s) used by the plugin. The default value is `src/main/docker`.
This option is only relevant for the `{task-prefix}Build` task.
| `jkube.build.source.dir`

| *authConfig*
| Authentication information when pulling from or pushing to Docker registry. There is a dedicated section
<<authentication, Authentication>> for how to do security.
|

| *autoPull*
a| Decide how to pull missing base images or images to start:

* `on` : Automatic download any missing images (default)
* `off` : Automatic pulling is switched off
* `always` : Pull images always even when they already exist locally
* `once` : For multi-module builds images are only checked once and pulled for the whole build.

| `jkube.docker.autoPull`


| [[image-pull-policy]] *imagePullPolicy*
a| Specify whether images should be pull when looking for base images while building or images for starting.
This property can take the following values (case insensitive):

* `IfNotPresent`: Automatic download any missing images (default)
* `Never` : Automatic pulling is switched off always
* `Always` : Pull images always even when they already exist locally.

By default, a progress meter is printed out on the console, which is omitted when using {plugin-type} in batch mode (option `-B`). A very simplified progress meter is provided when using no color output (i.e. with `-Djkube.useColor=false`).
| `jkube.docker.imagePullPolicy`

| *certPath*
| Path to SSL certificate when SSL is used for communicating with the Docker daemon. These certificates are normally
stored in `~/.docker/`. With this configuration the path can be set explicitly. If not set, the fallback is first
taken from the environment variable `DOCKER_CERT_PATH` and then as last resort `~/.docker/`. The keys in this are
expected with it standard names `ca.pem`, `cert.pem` and `key.pem`.
Please refer to the https://docs.docker.com/articles/https[Docker documentation] for more information about SSL
security with Docker.
| `jkube.docker.certPath`

| *dockerHost*
a| The URL of the Docker Daemon. If this configuration option is not given, then the optional `<machine>` configuration
section is consulted. The scheme of the URL can be either given directly as `http` or `https`
depending on whether plain HTTP communication is enabled or SSL should
be used. Alternatively the scheme could be `tcp` in which case the
protocol is determined via the IANA assigned port: 2375 for `http`
and 2376 for `https`. Finally, Unix sockets are supported by using
the scheme `unix` together with the filesystem path to the unix socket.

The discovery sequence used by the docker-maven-plugin to determine
the URL is:

. Value of *dockerHost* (`jkube.docker.host`)
. The Docker host associated with the docker-machine named in `<machine>`, i.e. the `DOCKER_HOST` from `docker-machine env`. See <<docker-machine,below>> for more information about Docker machine support.
. The value of the environment variable `DOCKER_HOST`.
. `unix:///var/run/docker.sock` if it is a readable socket.
| `jkube.docker.host`

| *filter*
| In order to temporarily restrict the operation of plugin goals this configuration option can be used.
Typically, this will be set via the system property `jkube.image.filter` when {plugin-type} is called. The value can be a single
image name (either its alias or full name) or it can be a comma separated list with multiple image names. Any name
which doesn't refer an image in the configuration will be ignored.
| `jkube.image.filter`

| *machine*
| Docker machine configuration. See <<docker-machine, Docker Machine>> for possible values.
|

| *maxConnections*
| Number of parallel connections are allowed to be opened to the Docker Host. For parsing log output, a connection needs
to be kept open (as well for the wait features), so don't put that number to low. Default is 100 which should be
suitable for most of the cases.
| `jkube.docker.maxConnections`

| *outputDirectory*
| Default output directory to be used by this plugin.
ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "maven"]
The default value is `target/docker` and is only used for the goal `{goal-prefix}:build`.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "gradle"]
The default value is `build/docker` and is only used for the goal `{task-prefix}Build`.
endif::[]
| `jkube.build.target.dir`

| *profile*
| Profile to which contains enricher and generators configuration. See <<profiles,Profiles>> for details.
| `jkube.profile`

| *registry*
| Specify globally a registry to use for pulling and pushing images. See <<registry,Registry handling>> for details.
| `jkube.docker.registry`

| *skip*
| With this parameter the execution of this plugin can be skipped completely.
| `jkube.skip`

| *skipBuild*
|
ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "maven"]
If set not images will be build (which implies also _skip.tag_) with `{goal-prefix}:build`.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "gradle"]
If set not images will be build (which implies also _skip.tag_) with `{task-prefix}Build`.
endif::[]

| `jkube.skip.build`

| *skipBuildPom*
| If set the build step will be skipped for modules of type `pom`. If not set, then by default projects of type `pom`
will be skipped if there are no image configurations contained.
| `jkube.skip.build.pom`

| *skipTag*
|
ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "maven"]
If set to `true` this plugin won't add any tags to images that have been built with `{goal-prefix}:build`.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "gradle"]
If set to `true` this plugin won't add any tags to images that have been built with `{task-prefix}Build`.
endif::[]

| `jkube.skip.tag`

| *skipMachine*
| Skip using docker machine in any case
| `jkube.docker.skip.machine`

| *sourceDirectory*
| Default directory that contains the assembly descriptor(s) used by the plugin. The default value is `src/main/docker`.
ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "maven"]
This option is only relevant for the `{goal-prefix}:build` goal.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "gradle"]
This option is only relevant for the `{task-prefix}Build` goal.

| `jkube.build.source.dir`

| *verbose*
| Boolean attribute for switching on verbose output like the build steps when doing a Docker build. Default is `false`.
| `jkube.docker.verbose`

| *logDate*
| The date format to use when logging messages from Docker. Default is `DEFAULT` (`HH:mm:ss.SSS`)
| `jkube.docker.logDate`

| *logStdout*
| Log to stdout regardless if log files are configured or not. Default is `false`.
| `jkube.docker.logStdout`
