[[build-kubernetes]]

A normal Docker build is performed by default.For Kubernetes builds the {plugin} uses the Docker remote API so the URL of your Docker Daemon must be specified.The URL can be specified by the dockerHost or machine configuration, or by the `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable.

The Docker remote API supports communication via SSL and authentication with certificates.The path to the certificates can be specified by the certPath or machine configuration, or by the `DOCKER_CERT_PATH` environment variable.

If you don't have access to docker daemon, you can change build strategy using `buildStrategy` option in {plugin-configuration-type} configuration like this:

ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "maven"]
include::maven/_mvn_buildstrategy.adoc[]
endif::[]
ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "gradle"]
include::gradle/_gradle_buildstrategy.adoc[]
endif::[]


These are the different options supported by `buildStrategy`:

.JKube Build Strategies
[cols="1,5"]
|===
| *buildStrategy* | *Description*
| `docker`
| Docker build with a binary source

| `buildpacks`
| Docker build using https://buildpacks.io/[Cloud Native Buildpacks]

| `jib`
| Deamonless container image creation using https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib[JIB] build
|===

ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "maven"]
{plugin} by default tries to build up an opinionated <<config-image, Image Configuration>> by inspecting `pom.xml`.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "gradle"]
{plugin} by default tries to build up an opinionated <<config-image, Image Configuration>> by inspecting `build.gradle`.
endif::[]


You can also provide your own <<dockerfile-scenario, Dockerfile>> or provide Custom ImageConfiguration via <<config-image-build, {plugin-type} configuration>>.
