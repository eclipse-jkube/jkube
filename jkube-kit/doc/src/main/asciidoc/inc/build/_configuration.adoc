All build relevant configuration is contained in the `build` section
of an image configuration. The following configuration options are supported:

[[config-image-build]]
.Build configuration (<<config-image, image>>)
[cols="1,5,1"]
|===
| Element | Description | Property

| <<config-image-build-assembly, *assembly*>>
| Specifies the assembly configuration as described in <<config-image-build-assembly,Build Assembly>>
| `jkube.container-image.assembly.xxx`

| <<property-buildargs, *args*>>
| Map specifying the value of https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/#set-build-time-variables-build-arg[Docker build args]
which should be used when building the image with an external Dockerfile which uses build arguments. The key-value syntax is the same as when defining {plugin-type} properties (or `labels` or `env`).
This argument is ignored when no external Dockerfile is used. Build args can also be specified as properties as
described in <<property-buildargs,Build Args>>
| `jkube.container-image.args`

| *buildOptions*
| Map specifying the build options to provide to the docker daemon when building the image. These options map to the ones listed as query parameters in the
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/api/docker_remote_api_v1.24/#build-image-from-a-dockerfile[Docker Remote API] and are restricted to simple options
(e.g.: memory, shmsize). If you use the respective configuration options for build options natively supported by the build configuration (i.e. `noCache`, `cleanup=remove` for buildoption `forcerm=1` and `args` for build args) then these will override any corresponding options given here. The key-value syntax is the same as when defining environment variables or labels as described in <<misc-env,Setting Environment Variables and Labels>>.
| `jkube.container-image.buildOptions`

| *createImageOptions*
| Map specifying the create image options to provide to the docker daemon when pulling or
  importing an image.
  These options map to the ones listed as query parameters in the
  https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.41/#operation/ImageCreate[Docker Remote API] and are
  restricted to simple options (e.g.: fromImage, fromSrc, platform).
|

| *cleanup*
| Cleanup dangling (untagged) images after each build (including any containers created from them). Default is `try` which tries to remove the old image, but doesn't fail the build if this is not possible because e.g. the image is still used by a running container. Use `remove` if you want to fail the build and `none` if no cleanup is requested.
| `jkube.container-image.cleanup`

| [[context-dir]]*contextDir*
| Path to a directory used for the build's context. You can specify the `Dockerfile` to use with *dockerFile*, which by default is the Dockerfile found in the `contextDir`. The Dockerfile can be also located outside of the `contextDir`, if provided with an absolute file path. See <<external-dockerfile, External Dockerfile>> for details.
| `jkube.container-image.contextDir`

| <<misc-startup, *cmd*>>
| A command to execute by default (i.e. if no command is provided when a container for this image is started). See <<misc-startup,Startup Arguments>> for details.
| `jkube.container-image.cmd`

| *compression*
|
ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "gradle"]
The compression mode how the build archive is transmitted to the docker daemon (`{task-prefix}Build`) and how docker build archives are attached to this build as sources. The value can be `none` (default), `gzip` or `bzip2`.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "maven"]
The compression mode how the build archive is transmitted to the docker daemon (`{goal-prefix}:build`) and how docker build archives are attached to this build as sources. The value can be `none` (default), `gzip` or `bzip2`.
endif::[]
|

| *dockerFile*
| Path to a `Dockerfile` which also triggers _Dockerfile mode_. See <<external-dockerfile, External Dockerfile>> for details.
| `jkube.container-image.dockerFile`

| *dockerArchive*
| Path to a saved image archive which is then imported. See <<external-dockerfile, Docker archive>> for details.
| `jkube.container-image.dockerArchive`

| <<misc-startup, *entryPoint*>>
| An entrypoint allows you to configure a container that will run as an executable. See <<misc-startup,Startup Arguments>> for details.
| `jkube.container-image.entrypoint`

| <<misc-env, *env*>>
| The environments as described in <<misc-env,Setting Environment Variables and Labels>>.
| `jkube.container-image.env`

  e.g. `jkube.container-image.env.FOO=bar`

| *filter*
| Enable and set the delimiters for property replacements. By default, properties in the format `${..}` are replaced with {plugin-type} properties. You can switch off property replacement by setting this property to `false`. When using a single char like `@` then this is used as a delimiter (e.g `@...@`). See <<build-filtering, Filtering>> for more details.
| `jkube.container-image.filter`

| [[build-config-from]]*from*
| The base image which should be used for this image. If not given this default to `busybox:latest` and is suitable for a pure data image.
ifeval::["{task-prefix}" == "oc"]
In case of an <<build-openshift,S2I Binary build>> this parameter specifies the S2I Builder Image to use, which by default is `fabric8/s2i-java:latest`. See also <<build-config-from-ext,from-ext>> how to add additional properties for the base image.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{goal-prefix}" == "oc"]
In case of an <<build-openshift,S2I Binary build>> this parameter specifies the S2I Builder Image to use, which by default is `fabric8/s2i-java:latest`. See also <<build-config-from-ext,from-ext>> how to add additional properties for the base image.
endif::[]
| `jkube.container-image.from`

| *buildpacksBuilderImage*
|  Configure https://buildpacks.io/docs/for-platform-operators/concepts/builder/[BuildPack builder] OCI image for BuildPack Build. This field is applicable only in `buildpacks` build strategy. This overrides builder image specified in local `~/.pack/config.toml`. If not specified this defaults to `null`.

  This field is only applicable for `buildpacks` build strategy.
|

| [[build-config-from-ext]]**fromExt**
a| Extended definition for a base image. This field holds a map of defined in `key = "value"` format. The known keys are:

* `name` : Name of the base image
ifeval::["{task-prefix}" == "oc"]
* `kind` : Kind of the reference to the builder image when in S2I build mode. By default its `ImageStreamTag` but can be also `ImageStream`. An alternative would be `DockerImage`
* `namespace` : Namespace where this builder image lives.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{goal-prefix}" == "oc"]
* `kind` : Kind of the reference to the builder image when in S2I build mode. By default its `ImageStreamTag` but can be also `ImageStream`. An alternative would be `DockerImage`
* `namespace` : Namespace where this builder image lives.

| *maintainer*
| The author (`MAINTAINER`) field for the generated image
| `jkube.container-image.maintainer`

| `jkube.container-image.optimise`

| *platforms*
a| List of `platform` elements with the target platforms (os/architecture) for which to build the image. Enables multi-platform builds.

You should use a base image that includes supports for multiple platforms such as:

| The exposed ports which is a list of `port` elements, one for each port to expose. Whitespace is trimmed from each element and empty elements are ignored. The format can be either pure numerical ("8080") or with the protocol attached ("8080/tcp").
| `jkube.container-image.ports`

  e.g. `jkube.container-image.ports.1=8080`

| *shell*
| Shell to be used for the *runCmds*. It contains *arg* elements which are defining the executable and its params.
| `jkube.container-image.shell`

| *runCmds*
| Commands to be run during the build process. It contains *run* elements which are passed to the shell. Whitespace is trimmed from each element and empty elements are ignored. The run commands are inserted right after the assembly and after *workdir* into the Dockerfile.
| `jkube.container-image.runCmds`

  e.g. `jkube.container-image.runCmds.1=groupadd -r appUser`

| *skip*

ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "maven"]
From this configuration this Plugin creates an in-memory Dockerfile,
copies over the assembled files and calls the Docker daemon via its
remote API.
