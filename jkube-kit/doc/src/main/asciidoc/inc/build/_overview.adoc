[[build-overview]]
Here are different modes how images can be built:

When using this mode, the Dockerfile is created on the fly with all instructions extracted from the configuration given.

[[external-dockerfile]]
.External Dockerfile or Docker archive
Alternatively an external Dockerfile template or Docker archive can be used. This mode is switched on by using one of these three configuration options within

* *contextDir* specifies docker build context if an external dockerfile is located outside of Docker build context. If not specified, Dockerfile's parent directory is used as build context.
* *dockerFile* specifies a specific Dockerfile path. The Docker build context directory is set to `contextDir` if given. If not the directory by default is the directory in which the Dockerfile is stored.
* *dockerArchive* specifies a previously saved image archive to load directly. If a `dockerArchive` is provided, no `dockerFile` must be given.

All paths can be either absolute or relative paths. A relative path is looked up in `$projectDir/src/main/docker` by default. You can make it easily an absolute path by using `$projectDir` in your configuration.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "maven"]
All paths can be either absolute or relative paths. A relative path is looked up in `${project.basedir}/src/main/docker` by default. You can make it easily an absolute path by using `${project.basedir}` in your configuration.
endif::[]

However, you need to add the files on your own in the Dockerfile with an `ADD` or `COPY` command.
The files of the assembly are stored in a build context relative directory `maven/` but can be changed by changing the assembly name with the option `name` in the assembly configuration.

E.g. the files can be added with
.Example
[source,dockerfile]
----
COPY maven/ /my/target/directory
----

so that the assembly files will end up in `/my/target/directory` within the container.

If this directory contains a `.jkube-dockerignore` (or alternatively, a `.jkube-dockerexclude` file), then it is used
for excluding files for the build. If the file doesn't exist, or it's empty, then there are no exclusions.

Each line in this file is treated as an entry in the `excludes` assembly `fileSet` <<build-assembly-layer, configuration >>.
Files can be referenced by using their relative path name.
Wildcards are also supported, patterns will be matched using
https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/file/FileSystem.html#getPathMatcher(java.lang.String)[
FileSystem#getPathMatcher] `glob` syntax.

It is similar to `.dockerignore` when using Docker but has a slightly different syntax (hence the different name).

<<ex-build-dockerexclude>> is an  example which excludes all compiled Java classes.

[[ex-build-dockerexclude]]
.Example `.jkube-dockerexclude` or `.jkube-dockerignore`
====
ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "gradle"]
[source]
----
build/classes/**  # <1>
----
<1> Exclude all compiled classes
endif::[]
ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "maven"]
[source]
----
target/classes/**  # <1>
----
<1> Exclude all compiled classes
endif::[]
====

If this directory contains a `.jkube-dockerinclude` file, then it is used for including only those files for the build.
If the file doesn't exist or it's empty, then everything is included.

Each line in this file is treated as an entry in the `includes` assembly `fileSet` <<build-assembly-layer, configuration >>.
Files can be referenced by using their relative path name.
Wildcards are also supported, patterns will be matched using
https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/file/FileSystem.html#getPathMatcher(java.lang.String)[
FileSystem#getPathMatcher] `glob` syntax.

<<ex-build-dockerinclude>> shows how to include only jar file that have build to the Docker build context.

[[ex-build-dockerinclude]]
.Example `.jkube-dockerinclude`
ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "gradle"]
====
[source]
----
build/libs/*.jar # <1>
----
<1> Only add jar file to you Docker build context.
====
endif::[]
ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "maven"]
====
[source]
----
target/*.jar  # <1>
----
<1> Only add jar file to you Docker build context.
====
endif::[]

Except for the <<build-assembly,assembly configuration>> all other configuration options are ignored for now.

[[simple-dockerfile-build]]
.Simple Dockerfile build

When only a single image should be built with a Dockerfile no {plugin-configuration-type} configuration is needed at all.
ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "gradle"]
All what need to be done is to place a `Dockerfile` into the top-level module directory, alongside to `build.gradle`.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "maven"]
All what need to be done is to place a `Dockerfile` into the top-level module directory, alongside to `pom.xml`.
endif::[]
You can still configure <<global-configuration, global aspects>> in the plugin configuration, but as soon as you add an `image` in the {plugin-configuration-type} configuration, you need to configure also the build explicitly.

The image name is by default set from the {plugin-type} coordinates (`%g/%a:%l`, see <<image-name,Image Name >> for an explanation of the params which are essentially the Gradle's group, project name and project version)
This name can be set with the property `jkube.image.name` in `gradle.properties`.

[[build-filtering]]
.Filtering
{plugin} filters given Dockerfile with {plugin-type} properties, much like the `maven-resource-plugin` does. Filtering is enabled by default and can be switched off with a build config `filter='false'`. Properties which we want to replace are specified with the `${..}` syntax.
Replacement includes properties set in the build, command-line properties, and system properties. Unresolved properties remain untouched.

This partial replacement means that you can easily mix it with Docker build arguments and environment variable reference, but you need to be careful.
If you want to be more explicit about the property delimiter to clearly separate Docker properties and {plugin-type} properties you can redefine the delimiter.
In general, the `filter` option can be specified the same way as delimiters in the resource plugin.
In particular,  if this configuration contains a * then the parts left, and right of the asterisks are used as delimiters.

For example, the default `filter='${*}'` parse {plugin-type} properties in the format that we know.
If you specify a single character for `filter` then this delimiter is taken for both, the start and the end.
E.g a `filter='@'` triggers on parameters in the format `@...@`.
Use something like this if you want to clearly separate from Docker builds args.
This form of property replacement works for Dockerfile only.
For replacing other data in other files targeted for the Docker image, please use the <<build-assembly,assembly configuration>> with filtering to make them available in the docker build context.

.Example
The following example replaces all properties in the format `@property@` within the Dockerfile.

ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "gradle"]
[source,groovy,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
{pluginExtension} {
    images {
        image {
            name = 'user/demo'
            build {
                filter = '@'
            }
        }
    }
}
