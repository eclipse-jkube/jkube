The following sections describe the usual configuration, which is similar to the build configuration used in the
https://dmp.fabric8.io[docker-maven-plugin].

In addition, a more automatic way for creating predefined build configuration can be performed with so called <<generators, Generators>>. Generators are very flexible and can be easily created. These are described in an extra <<generators, section>>. Note that if you're providing your own {plugin-configuration-type} image configuration, it would be given more precedence. Generators won't be used in case you're already using your own custom image configuration.

Global configuration parameters specify overall behavior common for all images to build. Some of the configuration options are shared with other goals.
