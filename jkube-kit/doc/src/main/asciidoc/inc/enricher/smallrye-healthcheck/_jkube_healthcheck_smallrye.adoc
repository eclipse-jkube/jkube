[[jkube-healthcheck-smallrye]]
==== jkube-healthcheck-smallrye

This enricher adds kubernetes readiness and liveness and startup probes for projects which have `io.smallrye:smallrye-health` dependency added for Health management. Note that Kubernetes startup probes are only added in projects using MicroProfile 3.1 and later.

===== Probe configuration

You can configure the different aspects of the probes.
