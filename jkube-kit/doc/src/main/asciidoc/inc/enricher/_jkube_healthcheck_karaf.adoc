==== jkube-healthcheck-karaf

This enricher adds kubernetes readiness and liveness probes with Apache Karaf. This requires that
`jkube-karaf-checks` has been enabled in the Karaf startup features.

The enricher will use the following settings by default:

- port = `8181`
- scheme = `HTTP`
- failureThreshold = `3`
- successThreshold = `1`

and use paths `/readiness-check` for readiness check and `/health-check` for liveness check.

These options cannot be configured.
