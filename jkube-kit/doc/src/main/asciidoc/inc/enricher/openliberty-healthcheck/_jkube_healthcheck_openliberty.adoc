==== jkube-healthcheck-openliberty

This enricher adds kubernetes readiness and liveness and startup probes for OpenLiberty based projects. Note that Kubernetes startup probes are only added in projects using MicroProfile 3.1 and later.

The application should be configured as follows to enable the enricher (i.e. Either `microProfile` or `mpHealth` should be enabled in Liberty Server Configuration file as pointed out in https://www.openliberty.io/docs/latest/reference/feature/mpHealth-4.0.html[OpenLiberty Health Docs])
