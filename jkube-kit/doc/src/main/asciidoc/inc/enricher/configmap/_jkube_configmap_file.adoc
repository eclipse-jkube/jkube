==== jkube-configmap-file

This enricher adds ConfigMap defined as `resources` in plugin configuration and/or resolves file content from an annotation.

ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "gradle"]
include::gradle/_entries_name_value_configuration.adoc[]
endif::[]

ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "maven"]
include::maven/_entries_name_value_configuration.adoc[]
endif::[]

This creates a ConfigMap data with key `A` and value `B`.

You can also use `file` tag to refer to the content of a file.

ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "gradle"]
include::gradle/_entries_file_configuration.adoc[]
endif::[]

ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "maven"]
include::maven/_entries_file_configuration.adoc[]
endif::[]

This creates a ConfigMap with key `test-application.properties` and value the content of the `src/test/resources/test-application.properties` file.
If you set `name` tag then this is used as key instead of the filename.

===== ConfigMap {plugin-configuration-type} Configuration
Here are the supported options while providing `configMap` in {plugin-configuration-type} configuration

.{plugin-configuration-type} configmap configuration `configMap`

| Element | Description

| <<configmap-entry-configuration, `entries`>>
| data for ConfigMap

| `name`
| Name of the ConfigMap

[[configmap-entry-configuration]]
===== ConfigMap Entry {plugin-configuration-type} Configuration
`entries` is a list of `entry` configuration objects. Here are the supported options while providing `entry` in {plugin-configuration-type} configuration

.{plugin-configuration-type} configmap entry configuration `entry`
[cols="1,5"]
|===
| Element | Description

| `value`
| Entry value

| `file`
| path to a file or directory. If it's a single file then file contents would be read as value. If it's a directory then each file's content is stored as value with file name as key.

| `name`
| Entry name
|===

If you are defining a custom `ConfigMap` file, you can use an annotation to define a file name as key and its content as the value:

ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "gradle"]
include::gradle/_configmap_annotation_file_configuration.adoc[]
endif::[]

ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "maven"]
include::maven/_configmap_annotation_file_configuration.adoc[]
endif::[]

This creates a `ConfigMap` data with key `application.properties` (part defined after `cm`) and value the content of `src/test/resources/test-application.properties` file. 

You can specify a directory instead of a file:

ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "gradle"]
include::gradle/_configmap_annotation_directory_configuration.adoc[]
endif::[]

ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "maven"]
include::maven/_configmap_annotation_directory_configuration.adoc[]
endif::[]

This creates a `ConfigMap` named `application.properties` (part defined after `cm`) and for each file under the directory `test-dir` one entry with file name as key and its content as the value; subdirectories are ignored.
