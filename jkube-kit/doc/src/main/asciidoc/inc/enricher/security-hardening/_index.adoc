* Disables the auto-mounting of the service account token.
* Prevents containers from running in privileged mode.
* Ensures containers do not allow privilege escalation.
* Prevents containers from running as the root user.
* Configures the container to run as a user with a high UID to avoid host conflict.
* Ensures the container's seccomp is set to Runtime/Default.
