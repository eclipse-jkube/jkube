[[integrations.dekorate]]
== Dekorate

*{plugin}* provides a Zero Configuration approach to delegate deployment manifests
generation to https://github.com/dekorateio/dekorate[Dekorate].

Just by adding a dependency to Dekorate library in the `pom.xml` file, all manifest
generation will be delegated to Dekorate.

A full example of the integration can be found in the directory
https://github.com/eclipse-jkube/jkube/tree/master/quickstarts/maven/spring-boot-dekorate[quickstarts/maven/spring-boot-dekorate].

An *experimental* feature is also provided to merge resources generated both by *{plugin}*
and Dekorate. You can activate this feature by using the following flag `-Djkube.mergeWithDekorate`
in the command-line, or setting it up as a property (`<jkube.mergeWithDekorate>true</jkube.mergeWithDekorate>`).

[[integrations.jib]]
== JIB (Java Image Builder)
*{plugin}* also provides user an option to build container images without having access to any docker daemon.
You just need to set `jkube.build.strategy` property to `jib`. It will delegate the build process to
https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib[JIB]. It creates a tarball inside your target directory which can be loaded
into any docker daemon afterwards. You may also push the image to your specified registry using push goal with feature flag enabled.

You can find more details at https://github.com/eclipse-jkube/jkube/tree/master/quickstarts/gradle/spring-boot-with-jib-assembly/[Spring Boot JIB With Assembly Quickstart].
endif::[]

[[integrations.buildpacks]]
== Buildpacks

*{plugin}* provides the required features for users to leverage https://buildpacks.io/[Cloud Native Buildpacks] for building container images.
You can enable this build strategy by setting the `jkube.build.strategy` property to `buildpacks`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Access to a Docker daemon is required in order to use Buildpacks as mentioned in https://buildpacks.io/docs/app-developer-guide/#prerequisites[Buildpack Prerequisites].

{plugin} downloads https://buildpacks.io/docs/tools/pack/[Pack CLI] to the user's `$HOME/.jkube` folder and starts the
`pack build` process. If the download for the https://buildpacks.io/docs/tools/pack/[Pack CLI] binary fails, {plugin} looks for any locally installed https://buildpacks.io/docs/tools/pack/[Pack CLI] version.

=== Buildpack Builder Image
- If no builder image is configured, then {plugin} uses `paketobuildpacks/builder:base` as the default builder image.
- If builder image is provided in local https://buildpacks.io/docs/tools/pack/cli/pack_config/[Pack Config], {plugin} uses the https://buildpacks.io/docs/concepts/components/builder/[builder image] specified in the file.
  For example,if the user has this image set in the `$HOME/.pack/config.toml` file, {plugin} will use `testuser/buildpacks-quarkus-builder:latest` as Buildpacks builder image.:
[source,toml,indent=2,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
default-builder-image = "testuser/buildpacks-quarkus-builder:latest"
----
- It's also possible to configure BuildPack builder image using property or {plugin-configuration-type} configuration. You can use this property to configure buildpacks builder image:
[source,properties,indent=2,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
jkube.generator.buildpacksBuilderImage = "testuser/buildpacks-quarkus-builder:latest"
----

[NOTE]
====
BuildPacks integration simply involves delegation of the build process to `pack` CLI. {plugin} has no control over how image gets built. This is controlled by BuildPack builder image. User is
responsible for making sure that valid configuration is provided for BuildPacks.
