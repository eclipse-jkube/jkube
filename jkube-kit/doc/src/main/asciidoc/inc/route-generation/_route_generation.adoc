an {cluster}
https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/networking/routes.html[Route] descriptor (`route.yml`) will also be
generated along the service if an {cluster} cluster is targeted.
If you do not want to generate a Route descriptor, you can set the `jkube.openshift.generateRoute` property to `false`.

*Note:*
Routes will be automatically generated for Services with recognized web ports (`80`, `443`, `8080`, `8443`, `9080`, , `9090`, `9443`).

If your service exposes any other port and you still want to generate a Route, you can do any of the following:

* Force the route creation by setting the `jkube.createExternalUrls` property to `true`.
* Force the route creation by using the `expose: true` label in the `Service`:
** Add the `expose: true` label in a `Service` fragment.
** Add the `expose: true` label by leveraging the <<jkube-service, JKube Service Enricher>> (`jkube.enricher.jkube-service.expose`).

.Route Generation Configuration
[cols="1,6,1"]
|===
| Element | Description | Property

| *generateRoute*
| If value is set to `false` then no Route descriptor will be generated.
By default it is set to `true`, which will create a `route.yml` descriptor and also add Route resource to `openshift.yml`.
| `jkube.openshift.generateRoute`

  `jkube.enricher.jkube-openshift-route.generateRoute`

| *tlsTermination*
a| tlsTermination indicates termination type. The following values are supported:

* edge (default)
* passthrough
* reencrypt

See https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/architecture/networking/routes.html#secured-routes or https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/networking/routes/secured-routes.html
| `jkube.enricher.jkube-openshift-route.tlsTermination`

| *tlsInsecureEdgeTerminationPolicy*
a| tlsInsecureEdgeTerminationPolicy indicates the desired behavior for insecure connections to a route.
While each router may make its own decisions on which ports to expose, this is normally port 80.

* Allow - traffic is sent to the server on the insecure port (default)
* Disable - no traffic is allowed on the insecure port.
* Redirect - clients are redirected to the secure port.

See https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/rest_api/network_apis/route-route-openshift-io-v1.html
| `jkube.enricher.jkube-openshift-route.tlsInsecureEdgeTerminationPolicy`
|===

Below is an example of generating a Route with "edge" termination and "Allow" insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy:

ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "maven"]
include::maven/_route_edge_insecure.adoc[]
endif::[]
ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "gradle"]
include::gradle/_route_edge_insecure.adoc[]
endif::[]


Adding certificates for routes is not directly supported in the pom, but can be added via a yaml fragment.

If you do not want to generate a Route descriptor, you can also specify so in the plugin configuration in your POM as seen below.

ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "maven"]
include::maven/_generate_route_false.adoc[]
endif::[]
ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "gradle"]
include::gradle/_generate_route_false.adoc[]
endif::[]


If you are using resource fragments, then also you can configure it in your Service resource fragment (e.g. `service.yml`).
You need to add an `expose` label to the `metadata` section of your service and set it to `false`.
