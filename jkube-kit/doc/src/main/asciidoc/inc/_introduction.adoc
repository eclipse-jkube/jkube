`jkube-kit` is a set of building blocks for creating awesome Docker, Kubernetes and OpenShift build tools.
Although its currently somewhat centered around Maven tooling, it's by no means Maven exclusively.

This repository covers the following abstraction which helps you to flexibly create Docker images and Kubernetes / OpenShift resource descriptors:

* **Generators** are used to examine you build configuration and creating Docker image configuration with opinionated defaults.
* **Enrichers** create default resource objects and enhance existing resource descriptors with various build related informations.
* **Profiles** combine a set of generator and enrichers with a configuration and give it a name so that the used generators and enrichers can be tuned to the details.
