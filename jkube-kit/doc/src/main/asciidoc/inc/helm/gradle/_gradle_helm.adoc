To generate the Helm chart you need to invoke the `{task-prefix}Helm` Gradle task on the command line:

[source, sh, subs="+attributes"]
----
gradle {task-prefix}Resource {task-prefix}Helm
----

[NOTE]
The `{task-prefix}Resource` goal is required to create the resource descriptors that are included in the Helm chart.
If you have already generated the resources in a previous step then you can omit this task.
