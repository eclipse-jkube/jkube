To run tests on a Helm release you need to invoke the `{task-prefix}HelmTest` gradle task on the command line:

[source, sh, subs="+attributes"]
----
gradle {task-prefix}Resource {task-prefix}Helm {task-prefix}HelmInstall {task-prefix}HelmTest
----

[NOTE]
The `{task-prefix}Resource`, `{task-prefix}Helm` and `{task-prefix}HelmInstall` tasks are required to ensure that Helm release gets installed in {cluster}.
If you already have the Helm release installed on {cluster}, then you can omit these tasks. You also need to make sure that you've a helm test template inside your
helm chart.
