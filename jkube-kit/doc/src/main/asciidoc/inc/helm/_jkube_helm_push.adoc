This goal is for pushing
https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts[Helm charts]
in a remote repository [Artifactory, Chartmuseum, Nexus].

ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "maven"]
To publish a Helm chart you simply call `{goal-prefix}:helm-push` goal on the command line:

include::maven/_resource_helm_push.adoc[]
endif::[]
ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "gradle"]
To publish a Helm chart you simply call `{task-prefix}HelmPush` task on the command line:

include::gradle/_resource_helm_push.adoc[]
endif::[]


ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "maven"]
The `{goal-prefix}:resource` and the `{goal-prefix}:helm` goals are required to create the resource descriptors which are included in the Helm chart and the Helm chart itself.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "gradle"]
The `{task-prefix}Resource` and the `{task-prefix}Helm` tasks are required to create the resource descriptors which are included in the Helm chart and the Helm chart itself.
endif::[]
If you have already built the resource and create the chart, then you can omit these goals.

The configuration is defined in a `helm` section within the plugin's configuration:

ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "maven"]
include::maven/_example_helm_push_config.adoc[]
endif::[]
ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "gradle"]
include::gradle/_example_helm_push_config.adoc[]
endif::[]
