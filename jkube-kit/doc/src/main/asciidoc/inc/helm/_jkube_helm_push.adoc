This goal is for pushing
https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts[Helm charts]
in a remote repository [Artifactory, Chartmuseum, Nexus].

ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "maven"]
To publish a Helm chart you simply call `{goal-prefix}:helm-push` goal on the command line:

include::maven/_resource_helm_push.adoc[]
endif::[]
ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "gradle"]
To publish a Helm chart you simply call `{task-prefix}HelmPush` task on the command line:

include::gradle/_resource_helm_push.adoc[]
endif::[]


ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "maven"]
The `{goal-prefix}:resource` and the `{goal-prefix}:helm` goals are required to create the resource descriptors which are included in the Helm chart and the Helm chart itself.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "gradle"]
The `{task-prefix}Resource` and the `{task-prefix}Helm` tasks are required to create the resource descriptors which are included in the Helm chart and the Helm chart itself.
endif::[]
If you have already built the resource and create the chart, then you can omit these goals.

The configuration is defined in a `helm` section within the plugin's configuration:

ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "maven"]
include::maven/_example_helm_push_config.adoc[]
endif::[]
ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "gradle"]
include::gradle/_example_helm_push_config.adoc[]
endif::[]

You can provide helm repository authentication credentials either via properties or using environment variables. It's also possible to specify credentials in maven settings as well. You just
need to add a server entry for your repo like this:

.Helm Repository Authentication credentials in settings.xml
[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0"
          xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
          xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>snapshot-repo-id</id>
      <username>admin</username>
      <password>secret</password>
    </server>
  </servers>

</settings>
