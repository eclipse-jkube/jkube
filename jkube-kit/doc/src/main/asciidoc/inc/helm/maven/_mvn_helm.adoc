To generate the Helm chart you need to invoke the`{goal-prefix}:helm` Maven goal on the command line:

[source, sh, subs="+attributes"]
----
mvn {goal-prefix}:resource {goal-prefix}:helm
----

[NOTE]
The `{goal-prefix}:resource` goal is required to create the resource descriptors that are included in the Helm chart.
If you have already generated the resources in a previous step then you can omit this  goal.
