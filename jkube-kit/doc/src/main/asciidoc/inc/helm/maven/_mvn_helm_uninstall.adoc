To uninstall a Helm release you need to invoke the `{goal-prefix}:helm-uninstall` Maven goal on the command line:

[source, sh, subs="+attributes"]
----
mvn {goal-prefix}:resource {goal-prefix}:helm {goal-prefix}:helm-install {goal-prefix}:helm-uninstall
----

[NOTE]
The `{goal-prefix}:resource`, `{goal-prefix}:helm` and `{goal-prefix}:helm-install` goals are required to ensure that Helm release gets installed in {cluster}.
If you already have the Helm release installed on {cluster}, then you can omit these goals.
