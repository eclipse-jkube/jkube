To publish a Helm chart you need to invoke the `{goal-prefix}:helm-push` Maven goal on the command line:

[source, sh, subs="+attributes"]
----
mvn {goal-prefix}:resource {goal-prefix}:helm {goal-prefix}:helm-push
----

[NOTE]
The `{goal-prefix}:resource` and the `{goal-prefix}:helm` goals are required to create the resource descriptors which are included in the Helm chart and the Helm chart itself.
If you have already built the resource and created the chart, then you can omit these goals.
