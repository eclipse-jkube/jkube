[[dockerfile-scenario]]
== Dockerfile

You can build a container image and deploy to Kubernetes with {plugin} by just providing a <<external-dockerfile, Dockerfile>>.
{plugin} builds a container image based on your Dockerfile and generates
opinionated Kubernetes manifests by inspecting it.

[[simple-dockerfile-mode-scenario]]
*Placing Dockerfile in project root directory*

ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "maven"]
You can place the Dockerfile in the project root directory along with `pom.xml`.
endif::[]

ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "gradle"]
You can place the Dockerfile in the project root directory along with `build.gradle`.
endif::[]


{plugin} detects it and automatically builds an image based on this Dockerfile.
There is no need to provide any sort of configuration apart from Dockerfile and project root directory as docker context directory.
The Image is created with an opinionated name from group, artifact and version.
The name can be overridden by using the `jkube.image.name` property.
Read <<simple-dockerfile-build, Simple Dockerfile>> section for more details.

[[docker-file-provided-mode-scenario]]
*Placing Dockerfile in some other directory*

You can choose to place your Dockerfile at some other location.
By default, the plugin assumes it to be `src/main/docker`, but you'll need to configure docker context directory in plugin configuration.
When not specified, context directory is assumed to be Dockerfile's parent directory.
You can take a look at https://github.com/eclipse/jkube/tree/master/quickstarts/gradle/docker-file-provided-docker-file[Docker File Provided Quickstarts] for more details.

[[docker-file-mode-include-exclude]]
*Controlling what gets copied to image*

When using Dockerfile mode, every file and directory present in the Docker build context directory
gets copied to the created Docker image.
In case you want to ignore some files, or you want to include only a specific set of files,
the {plugin} provides the following options to achieve this:

- <<ex-build-dockerinclude, `.jkube-dockerinclude`>> : Include only a specific set of files specified in this file
- <<ex-build-dockerexclude, `.jkube-dockerexclude`>> : Exclude a certain set of files from being copied into container image
- <<ex-build-dockerexclude, `.jkube-dockerignore`>>  : Same as `.jkube-dockerexclude`, ignore certain files from being copied into container image

[[docker-file-mode-property-placeholders]]
*Using Property placeholders in Dockerfiles*

You can reference properties in your Dockerfiles using standard maven property placeholders `${*}`. For example, if you have a property in your `gradle.properties` like this:

.gradle.properties
----
fromImage = fabric8/s2i-java
----

.Dockerfile
[source,dockerfile]
----
FROM ${fromImage}:latest-java11
----

You can override placeholders using the filter field in image build configuration, see <<build-filtering, Build Filtering>> for more details.
