*Building container Image of your application*

In case of OpenShift, https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.9/openshift_images/using_images/using-s21-images.html[Source to Image (S2I)] builds are performed by default. ImageStream is updated after the image creation.

Run this command which would build your application's container image and push it to OpenShift's internal container registry:

ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "maven"]
[source,sh,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ ./mvnw {goal-prefix}:build
----
endif::[]

ifeval::["{plugin-type}" == "gradle"]
[source,sh,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ ./gradlew {task-prefix}Build
----
endif::[]
